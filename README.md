## <u>Planning Process</u>

#### Planning
1. Clearly define the problem statement related to Natural Language Processing, determining site to scrape repositories and scope of data to scrape. Formulate intial questions. Keep in mind that GitHub's API and repository content may change over time, so **time stamp intial scrape** and ensure your scraping and data processing methods are adaptable to potential modifications in the API or repository structures.

2. As a preliminary step, identify the scripting language used in each repository by inspecting its primary programming language. This can be extracted from GitHub's repository metadata.

3. Create a detailed README.md file documenting the project's context, dataset characteristics, and analysis procedure for easy reproducibility.

#### Acquisition and Preparation
1. **Acquiring Data from GitHub Readme Files by Scraping the GitHub API** Must secure a GitHub token https://github.com/settings/tokens. Utilize the GitHub API to access the README files of the selected repositories. Extract the README content using API calls for each repository. Ensure you adhere to rate limits and fetch the necessary data efficiently.
2. **Cleaning and Preparing Data Using RegEx and Beautiful Soup Libraries** Process the raw README content to remove HTML tags, code snippets, and other irrelevant elements using Beautiful Soup. Employ regular expressions (RegEx) to clean the text further by eliminating special characters, punctuation, and numbers, while retaining meaningful text.

3. **Cleaning and Preparing Data Using RegEx and Beautiful Soup:** Process the raw README content to remove HTML tags, code snippets, and other irrelevant elements using Beautiful Soup. Employ regular expressions (RegEx) to clean the text further by eliminating special characters, punctuation, and numbers, while retaining meaningful text.

4. Preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers effectively during data loading and cleansing.

5. Perform feature selection meticulously, identifying influential features impacting the prevalence of the chronic disease through correlation analysis, feature importance estimation, or domain expertise-based selection criteria.

6. Develop specialized scripts (e.g., acquire.py and wrangle.py) for efficient and consistent data acquisition, preparation, and data splitting.

7. Safeguard proprietary aspects of the project by implementing confidentiality and data security measures, using .gitignore to exclude sensitive information.

#### Exploratory Analysis
1. **Exploring Data for Relevant Keyword Grouping Using Bi-grams and Unigrams:** Implement a mechanism to tokenize the cleaned text into words. Create bi-grams (pairs of adjacent words) and unigram (single word or ) from the tokenized text. Calculate the frequency of these word sequences within the repository data.

   This step involves:
   - Tokenization: Split the cleaned text into individual words.
   - Unigram Generation: Generate sequences of single word .
   - Frequency Calculation: Count the occurrences of each bi-gram and unigram.

   By analyzing the most frequent bi-grams and unigrams, you can identify keyword groupings that occur frequently in the READMEs. These groupings could represent significant terms, programming concepts, or patterns prevalent across the repositories.

2. Utilize exploratory data analysis techniques, employing compelling visualizations and relevant statistical tests to extract meaningful patterns and relationships within the dataset.

#### Modeling
1. Carefully choose a suitable machine learning algorithm based on feature selection and features engineered, evaluating options like K- Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, tailored for the classification regression task.

2. Implement the selected machine learning models using robust libraries (e.g., scikit-learn), splitting the data, systematically evaluating multiple models with a fixed Random State value = 123 for reproducibility.

3. Train the models rigorously to ensure optimal learning and model performance.

4. Conduct rigorous model validation techniques to assess model generalization capability and reliability.

5. Select the most effective model(e.g Logistic Regression), based on accuracy and a thorough evaluation of metrics before selecting best model to test.

#### Product Delivery
1. Assemble a final notebook, combining superior visualizations, well-trained models, and pertinent data to present comprehensive insights and conclusions with scientific rigor.

2. Generate a Prediction.csv file containing predictions from the chosen model on test data for further evaluation and utilization.

3. Maintain meticulous project documentation, adhering to scientific and professional standards, to ensure successful presentation or seamless deployment.

## <u>Conclusion</u>
In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), our analysis delved into the linguistic patterns and language prevalence within the READMEs of the top 100 most forked repositories on GitHub. Our findings uncovered several intriguing insights. Firstly, we observed a slightly higher prevalence of the Python language within README contents, constituting 54% of the distribution compared to JavaScript's 46%. Delving into the most frequently used words, "model" surfaced as a dominant term across the repository ReadMe texts, particularly pronounced within the Python language. Additionally, the word "function" held significance across all repositories, notably emerging as the most frequent term in JavaScript. Notably, we conducted a t-test on the frequency of the top 5 most significant words ("learning," "test," "library," "create," and "line"), which all demonstrated a statistically significant relationship with their respective programming languages.

Our exploration extends beyond linguistics to encompass statistical and machine learning techniques. We incorporated classification models including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Remarkably, the Random Forest model exhibited a strong performance, achieving a 63% accuracy in correctly predicting Python or JavaScript. While the baseline model predicted languages with a 54% accuracy, the Random Forest model surpassed it by 9%. This comprehensive analysis unveils the intricacies of predicting programming languages from GitHub README.md files while offering insights into resonating words within the developer community and open-source coding practices.

## <u>Recommendations</u>
1. **Use this model:** As it increases performance and therefore gives predictive power to users, we recommend using the Random Forest model over the baseine model for this use case.
2. **Further Explore  TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Exploring TF-IDF can provide valuable insights by quantifying the importance of words in documents, enabling more accurate text analysis and feature representation in future NLP project interations.
3. **Code Reusability and Patterns:** Responding to the significance of "model" and "function" as highly frequent terms, prioritize the promotion of code reusability and design patterns associated with these concepts. Craft libraries, modules, or templates that encapsulate common functionalities or algorithms related to models and functions. This strategic approach fosters efficient development, encourages uniform coding practices, and contributes to cohesive project architectures.
