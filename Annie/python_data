Python注重可读性，并使用空格/缩进代替括号{}5. python 包管理器称为PIP“ pip install packages”，具有超过200.000可用的软件包。6. Python 附带安装了pip和一个大的标准库，为程序员提供了许多预置的解决方案。7. 在python中，“一切”都是一个对象。还有许多其他特性，但这是每个python程序员都应该知道的主要特性。Python支持哪些数据类型，哪些是可变的？ 如何显示某个数据类型是可变的?可变数据类型是:ListDictionarySet不可变数据类型是:Numbers (int, float, ...)StringBoolTupleFrozenset通常，你可以使用函数hash（）来检查对象的可变性，如果它是可哈希的，则是不可变的，尽管由于用户定义的对象可能是可变的且可哈希的，所以它并不总是按预期工作什么是PEP8? 举例说明3种风格指南PEP8是Python的编码约定和样式指南的列表5 种样式指南:将所有行限制为最多79个字符。用两个空行包围顶级函数和类定义。制作一个元素的元组时使用逗号使用空格（而不是制表符）进行缩进每个缩进级别使用4个空格解释一下继承以及如何在Python中使用它根据定义，继承是一种机制，其中一个对象充当另一个对象的基础，并保留其所有对象属性。因此，如果B类继承自A类，那么A类的每个特征也将在B类中提供。A类将是“基类”，B类将是“派生类”。当你有几个共享相同功能的类时，这很方便。基本语法:class Base: passclass Derived(Base): passA more forged example:class Animal:    def __init__(self):        print(\""and I'm alive!\"")    def eat(self, food):        print(\""ñom ñom ñom\"", food)class Human(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is ', name)        super().__init__()    def write_poem(self):        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')class Dog(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is', name)        super().__init__()    def bark(self):        print('woof woof')michael = Human('Michael')michael.eat('Spam')michael.write_poem()bruno = Dog('Bruno')bruno.eat('bone')bruno.bark()>>> My name is  Michael>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!>>> My name is Bruno>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom bone>>> woof woof调用super（）会调用Base方法，因此，调用super().__init__() 就是调用 Animal__init__。有一个称为 MetaClasses 的更高级的python功能，可帮助程序员直接控制类的创建。 什么是一个错误? 什么是一个异常? 你熟悉哪些异常类型?＃ 请注意，你通常不需要了解编译过程，而只需知道一切都来自哪里＃ 并给出完整的答案表明你真正知道你在说什么。通常，每个编译过程都有两个步骤。    - 分析    - 产生代码.        Analysis can be broken into:        1. 词法分析   (标记源代码)        2. 语法分析 (如果语法正确，请检查标记是否合法，tldr)                          for i in 'foo'                          ^             SyntaxError: invalid syntax                We missed ':'                        3. 语义分析  (上下文分析，合法语法仍然会触发错误，你是否尝试过除以0，哈希可变对象或使用未声明的函数?)                           1/0                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero            这三个分析步骤负责错误处理。        第二步将负责错误，主要是语法错误，这是最常见的错误。    第三步将负责异常。        如我们所见，异常是语义错误，有许多内置的异常：        ImportError        ValueError        KeyError        FileNotFoundError        IndentationError        IndexError        ...        你还可以具有用户定义的异常，这些异常必须直接或间接地从Exception类继承。    常见例子:            class DividedBy2Error(Exception):        def __init__(self, message):            self.message = message            def division(dividend,divisor):        if divisor == 2:            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')        return dividend / divisor        division(100, 2)        >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!解释 异常处理以及如何在Python中使用它编写一个可以恢复字符串的程序（例如，pizza -> azzip）最简单的是 str[::-1] 但不是效率最高的.\""经典\"" 方式:foo = ''for char in 'pizza':    foo = char + foo>> 'azzip'   编写一个函数以返回一个或多个数字的和。 用户将决定要使用多少个数字首先，你询问用户要使用的数字量。 使用while循环，每个循环将amount_of_numbers减1，直到amount_of_numbers变为0。 在while循环中，你想询问用户一个数字，该数字将在每次循环运行时添加一个变量。def return_sum():\tamount_of_numbers = int(input(\""How many numbers? \""))\ttotal_sum = 0\twhile amount_of_numbers != 0:\t\tnum = int(input(\""Input a number. \""))\t\ttotal_sum += num\t\tamount_of_numbers -= 1\treturn total_sum如何将两个排序列表合并为一个排序列表? _ 在 Python 中用于什么?i18n中的翻译查询将最后执行的表达式或语句的结果保存在交互式解释器中。作为通用“可丢弃”变量名。 例如：x，y，_ = get_data（）（使用了x和y，但是由于我们不关心第三个变量，因此我们将其“扔掉了”）。Algorithms Implementation你可以在Python中实现“二分法搜索”吗?Files如何写文件?with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:    file.write(\""My insightful comment\"")如何反转文件?Regex如何在Python中执行与正则表达式相关的操作？ （匹配模式，替代字符串等）使用 re 模式如何用 \""blue\"" 替换字符串 \""green\""?如何找到一个变量中的所有IP地址？ 如何在文件中找到它们?按每个嵌套列表的第二项对列表列表进行排序li = [[1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 9], [4, 2], [4, 5]]sorted(x, key=lambda l: l[1])你可以编写一个函数来打印给定目录中的所有文件吗？ 包括子目录你有下面的列表: [{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]  获取所有的食物类型，最后输出: {'mushrooms', 'goombas', 'turtles'}brothers_menu =  \\[{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]# \""经典\"" 方式def get_food(brothers_menu) -> set:    temp = []    for brother in brothers_menu:        for food in brother['food']:            temp.append(food)    return set(temp)# 一直先行方式 (Using list comprehension)set([food for bro in x for food in bro['food']])什么是List 加强？ 它比典型的循环更好吗？ 为什么？ 你能示范如何使用它吗?怎样反转 string?最简短的方式是: my_string[::-1] 但是这不是效率最高的. 经典方式是:def reverse_string(string):    temp = \""\""    for char in string:        temp =  char + temp    return temp如何按值对字典排序?如何按键对字典排序?解释数据序列化以及如何使用Python执行你如何在Python中处理参数解析?解释什么是GIL什么是迭代器? 为什么使用迭代器?解释以下方法的类型以及如何使用它们:Static methodClass methodinstance method怎样反转 list?空的 return 返回什么?Time Complexity描述操作的时间复杂度access, search insert and remove 下面的数据结构:StackQueueLinked ListBinary Search Tree以下算法的最好，最差和平均情况的复杂度是什么?:QuicksortMergesortBucket SortRadix Sort  高级解释什么是装饰器你能展示如何编写和使用装饰器吗?编写脚本来确定给定端口上是否可以访问给定主机这个查询熟悉数据类吗？ 你能解释一下他们是干什么用的吗?解释一下上下文管理解释一下缓冲协议解释一下描述符你有抓取网络（爬虫）的经验吗？ 你能描述一下你用过什么以及用什么?你可以在Python中实现链接链表吗?你已经创建了一个网页，用户可以在其中上传文档。 但是，根据文档大小，读取上传文件的功能会运行很长时间，并且用户必须等待读取操作完成才能继续使用该网站。 你怎么能解决这个问题?Prometheus初级什么是Prometheus? Prometheus的主要特点是什么?描述 Prometheus 架构和组件你能否将 Prometheus 与其他解决方案（例如InfluxDB）进行比较?什么是an Alert?描述以下Prometheus组件:Prometheus serverPush GatewayAlert Manager负责抓取存储数据的Prometheus服务器推送网关用于短期作业警报管理负责警报 ;）什么是一个实例?

在Go中，我们可以重新声明变量，并且一旦声明就必须使用它.错. 我们不能重新声明变量，必须使用声明的变量。你使用了哪些Go库?应该根据你的使用情况回答此问题，一些示例是：fmt - formatted I/O下面代码块有什么问题? 怎么解决?func main() {    var x float32 = 13.5    var y int    y = x}下面的代码块尝试将整数101转换为字符串，但相反，我们得到“ e”。 这是为什么？ 怎么解决?package mainimport \""fmt\""func main() {    var x int = 101    var y string    y = string(x)    fmt.Println(y)}它看起来在101处设置了什么unicode值，并将其用于将整数转换为字符串。如果要获取“ 101”，则应使用“ strconv” 软件包，然后替换 y = string(x) with y = strconv.Itoa(x)以下代码块什么是错的?:package mainfunc main() {    var x = 2    var y = 3    const someConst = x + y}以下代码块的输出是什么？:package mainimport \""fmt\""const (\tx = iota\ty = iota)const z = iotafunc main() {\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", x)\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", y)\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", z)} _ 在 Go 中的用途是什么?以下代码块的输出是什么？:package mainimport \""fmt\""const (\t_ = iota + 3\tx)func main() {\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", x)}Mongo初级MongoDB有什么优势？ 换句话说，为什么选择 MongoDB 而不选择 NoSQL 的其他实现?SQL和NoSQL之间的区别是什么?主要区别在于SQL数据库是结构化的（数据以带有行和列的表格-像是Excel电子表格表格），而NoSQL是非结构化的，并且数据存储会根据NoSQL DB的设置方式而有所不同，例如作为键值对，面向文档等在哪种情况下，这个查询希望使用 NoSQL/Mongo 而不是SQL?经常变化的异构数据  * 数据一致性和完整性不是重中之重  * 最好，如果数据库需要快速扩展什么是一个文档? 什么是一个集合?什么是一个聚合?那个更好? 嵌入文档还是引用?Queries解释这个查询: db.books.find({\""name\"": /abc/})解释这个查询: db.books.find().sort({x:1})OpenShift初级什么是OpenShift? 你用过吗？ 如果有，是怎样使用的？你能解释一下 OpenShift 和 Kubernetes 之间的区别吗?定义 Pods 以及解释什么是有状态的 pods你熟悉哪些类型的构建策略?解释标签是什么以及它们的用途解释什么是注释以及它们与标签的区别解释什么是Downward APIShell 脚本初级告诉我你使用Shell脚本的经验脚本中的这一行是什么意思?: #!/bin/bash你倾向于在编写的每个脚本中包含什么?对还是错?: 当某个命令行失败时，默认情况下，该脚本将退出并且不会继续运行取决于所使用的语言和设置，例如在Bash中，默认情况下，脚本将继续运行。今天，我们拥有Ansible之类的工具和技术。 为什么还会有人使用Shell脚本?说出下面每个命令的结果是什么：echo $0echo $?echo $$echo $@echo $#你如何调试Shell脚本?如何在Shell脚本中从用户获得输入?解释一下条件语句以及如何使用它们什么是循环?

If you care about the fidelity of the voice you're cloning, and its expressivity, here are some personal recommendations of alternative voice cloning solutions:Check out CoquiTTS for an open source repository that is more up-to-date, with a better voice cloning quality and more functionalities.Check out paperswithcode for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.Check out Resemble.ai (disclaimer: I work there) for state of the art voice cloning with little hassle.Setup1. Install RequirementsBoth Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using venv, but this is optional.Install ffmpeg. This is necessary for reading audio files.Install PyTorch. Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.Install the remaining requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt2. (Optional) Download Pretrained ModelsPretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn't work for you, you can manually download them here.3. (Optional) Test ConfigurationBefore you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:python demo_cli.pyIf all tests pass, you're good to go.4. (Optional) Download DatasetsFor playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading LibriSpeech/train-clean-100. Extract the contents as <datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100 where <datasets_root> is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.5. Launch the ToolboxYou can then try the toolbox:python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>orpython demo_toolbox.pydepending on whether you downloaded any datasets. If you are running an X-server or if you have the error Aborted (core dumped), see this issue."
8,tiangolo/fastapi,https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/master/README.md,Python,"      FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production                Documentation: https://fastapi.tiangolo.comSource Code: https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapiFastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.The key features are:Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.SponsorsOther sponsorsOpinions\""[...] I'm using FastAPI a ton these days. [...] I'm actually planning to use it for all of my team's ML services at Microsoft. Some of them are getting integrated into the core Windows product and some Office products.\""Kabir Khan - Microsoft (ref)\""We adopted the FastAPI library to spawn a REST server that can be queried to obtain predictions. [for Ludwig]\""Piero Molino, Yaroslav Dudin, and Sai Sumanth Miryala - Uber (ref)\""Netflix is pleased to announce the open-source release of our crisis management orchestration framework: Dispatch! [built with FastAPI]\""Kevin Glisson, Marc Vilanova, Forest Monsen - Netflix (ref)\""I’m over the moon excited about FastAPI. It’s so fun!\""Brian Okken - Python Bytes podcast host (ref)\""Honestly, what you've built looks super solid and polished. In many ways, it's what I wanted Hug to be - it's really inspiring to see someone build that.\""Timothy Crosley - Hug creator (ref)\""If you're looking to learn one modern framework for building REST APIs, check out FastAPI [...] It's fast, easy to use and easy to learn [...]\""\""We've switched over to FastAPI for our APIs [...] I think you'll like it [...]\""Ines Montani - Matthew Honnibal - Explosion AI founders - spaCy creators (ref) - (ref)\""If anyone is looking to build a production Python API, I would highly recommend FastAPI. It is beautifully designed, simple to use and highly scalable, it has become a key component in our API first development strategy and is driving many automations and services such as our Virtual TAC Engineer.\""Deon Pillsbury - Cisco (ref)Typer, the FastAPI of CLIsIf you are building a CLI app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out Typer.Typer is FastAPI's little sibling.

DevOps 帮助我们完成什么?DevOps 的反模式是什么?什么是持续集成?开发人员经常将代码集成到共享仓库中的一种开发实践。 它的范围可以从每天或每周进行几次更改，到大规模在一个小时内进行几次更改。验证每段代码（更改/补丁），以使更改可以安全地合并。 如今，使用自动构建来确保代码可以集成的测试更改是一种常见的做法。 它可以是一个运行在不同级别（单元，功能等）的多个测试的构建，也可以是所有或某些必须通过以将更改合并到存储库中的多个单独的构建。什么是持续部署?什么是持续交付?你认为CI / CD的最佳做法是什么?你将用于以下哪些系统和/或工具？：CI/CD基础架构配置管理监控 & 报警日志代码审查代码覆盖率测试集CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis基础架构 - Terraform, CloudFormation配置管理 - Ansible, Puppet, Chef监控 & 报警 - Prometheus, Nagios日志 - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd代码审查 - Gerrit, Review Board代码覆盖率 - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo测试集 - Robot, Serenity, Gauge你在选择工具/技术时是怎么考虑的?你可以使用以下一项或全部：   * 成熟与尖端   * 社区规模   * 体系结构方面-代理与无代理，主控与无主控等解释可变基础架构与不变基础架构在可变的基础架构原则中，更改将应用到现有基础架构之上并随着时间的推移而变化基础架构建立了变化的历史。 Ansible，Puppet和Chef这些工具遵循可变的基础架构原则。在不变的基础架构原则中，每项更改实际上都是新的基础架构。 所以改变到服务器将导致新服务器而不是更新服务器。 Terraform是遵循不变的基础架构原则的一个例子。你熟悉什么方式来交付软件?  * 存档 - 将你所有的应用文件收集到一个存档中（例如tar），并将其交付给用户。  * 打包 - 取决于操作系统，你可以使用OS软件包格式（例如，在RHEL / Fefodra中为RPM）来交付软件，并使用标准打包程序命令来安装，卸载和更新它  * 映像 - VM或容器映像，其中包已包含在其中，以便成功运行。什么是缓存? 缓存是怎么工作的? 为什么缓存很重要?解释一下无状态和有状态什么是HTTP及其工作方式?描述一下设置某些类型的Web服务器的工作流程 (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)解释一下监控. 它是什么?

Python注重可读性，并使用空格/缩进代替括号{}5. python 包管理器称为PIP“ pip install packages”，具有超过200.000可用的软件包。6. Python 附带安装了pip和一个大的标准库，为程序员提供了许多预置的解决方案。7. 在python中，“一切”都是一个对象。还有许多其他特性，但这是每个python程序员都应该知道的主要特性。Python支持哪些数据类型，哪些是可变的？ 如何显示某个数据类型是可变的?可变数据类型是:ListDictionarySet不可变数据类型是:Numbers (int, float, ...)StringBoolTupleFrozenset通常，你可以使用函数hash（）来检查对象的可变性，如果它是可哈希的，则是不可变的，尽管由于用户定义的对象可能是可变的且可哈希的，所以它并不总是按预期工作什么是PEP8? 举例说明3种风格指南PEP8是Python的编码约定和样式指南的列表5 种样式指南:将所有行限制为最多79个字符。用两个空行包围顶级函数和类定义。制作一个元素的元组时使用逗号使用空格（而不是制表符）进行缩进每个缩进级别使用4个空格解释一下继承以及如何在Python中使用它根据定义，继承是一种机制，其中一个对象充当另一个对象的基础，并保留其所有对象属性。因此，如果B类继承自A类，那么A类的每个特征也将在B类中提供。A类将是“基类”，B类将是“派生类”。当你有几个共享相同功能的类时，这很方便。基本语法:class Base: passclass Derived(Base): passA more forged example:class Animal:    def __init__(self):        print(\""and I'm alive!\"")    def eat(self, food):        print(\""ñom ñom ñom\"", food)class Human(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is ', name)        super().__init__()    def write_poem(self):        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')class Dog(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is', name)        super().__init__()    def bark(self):        print('woof woof')michael = Human('Michael')michael.eat('Spam')michael.write_poem()bruno = Dog('Bruno')bruno.eat('bone')bruno.bark()>>> My name is  Michael>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!>>> My name is Bruno>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom bone>>> woof woof调用super（）会调用Base方法，因此，调用super().__init__() 就是调用 Animal__init__。有一个称为 MetaClasses 的更高级的python功能，可帮助程序员直接控制类的创建。 什么是一个错误? 什么是一个异常? 你熟悉哪些异常类型?＃ 请注意，你通常不需要了解编译过程，而只需知道一切都来自哪里＃ 并给出完整的答案表明你真正知道你在说什么。通常，每个编译过程都有两个步骤。    - 分析    - 产生代码.        Analysis can be broken into:        1. 词法分析   (标记源代码)        2. 语法分析 (如果语法正确，请检查标记是否合法，tldr)                          for i in 'foo'                          ^             SyntaxError: invalid syntax                We missed ':'                        3. 语义分析  (上下文分析，合法语法仍然会触发错误，你是否尝试过除以0，哈希可变对象或使用未声明的函数?)                           1/0                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero            这三个分析步骤负责错误处理。        第二步将负责错误，主要是语法错误，这是最常见的错误。    第三步将负责异常。        如我们所见，异常是语义错误，有许多内置的异常：        ImportError        ValueError        KeyError        FileNotFoundError        IndentationError        IndexError        ...        你还可以具有用户定义的异常，这些异常必须直接或间接地从Exception类继承。    常见例子:            class DividedBy2Error(Exception):        def __init__(self, message):            self.message = message            def division(dividend,divisor):        if divisor == 2:            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')        return dividend / divisor        division(100, 2)        >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!解释 异常处理以及如何在Python中使用它编写一个可以恢复字符串的程序（例如，pizza -> azzip）最简单的是 str[::-1] 但不是效率最高的.\""经典\"" 方式:foo = ''for char in 'pizza':    foo = char + foo>> 'azzip'   编写一个函数以返回一个或多个数字的和。 用户将决定要使用多少个数字首先，你询问用户要使用的数字量。 使用while循环，每个循环将amount_of_numbers减1，直到amount_of_numbers变为0。 在while循环中，你想询问用户一个数字，该数字将在每次循环运行时添加一个变量。def return_sum():\tamount_of_numbers = int(input(\""How many numbers? \""))\ttotal_sum = 0\twhile amount_of_numbers != 0:\t\tnum = int(input(\""Input a number. \""))\t\ttotal_sum += num\t\tamount_of_numbers -= 1\treturn total_sum如何将两个排序列表合并为一个排序列表? _ 在 Python 中用于什么?i18n中的翻译查询将最后执行的表达式或语句的结果保存在交互式解释器中。作为通用“可丢弃”变量名。 例如：x，y，_ = get_data（）（使用了x和y，但是由于我们不关心第三个变量，因此我们将其“扔掉了”）。Algorithms Implementation你可以在Python中实现“二分法搜索”吗?Files如何写文件?with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:    file.write(\""My insightful comment\"")如何反转文件?Regex如何在Python中执行与正则表达式相关的操作？ （匹配模式，替代字符串等）使用 re 模式如何用 \""blue\"" 替换字符串 \""green\""?如何找到一个变量中的所有IP地址？ 如何在文件中找到它们?按每个嵌套列表的第二项对列表列表进行排序li = [[1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 9], [4, 2], [4, 5]]sorted(x, key=lambda l: l[1])你可以编写一个函数来打印给定目录中的所有文件吗？ 包括子目录你有下面的列表: [{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]  获取所有的食物类型，最后输出: {'mushrooms', 'goombas', 'turtles'}brothers_menu =  \\[{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]# \""经典\"" 方式def get_food(brothers_menu) -> set:    temp = []    for brother in brothers_menu:        for food in brother['food']:            temp.append(food)    return set(temp)# 一直先行方式 (Using list comprehension)set([food for bro in x for food in bro['food']])什么是List 加强？ 它比典型的循环更好吗？ 为什么？ 你能示范如何使用它吗?怎样反转 string?最简短的方式是: my_string[::-1] 但是这不是效率最高的. 经典方式是:def reverse_string(string):    temp = \""\""    for char in string:        temp =  char + temp    return temp如何按值对字典排序?如何按键对字典排序?解释数据序列化以及如何使用Python执行你如何在Python中处理参数解析?解释什么是GIL什么是迭代器? 为什么使用迭代器?解释以下方法的类型以及如何使用它们:Static methodClass methodinstance method怎样反转 list?空的 return 返回什么?Time Complexity描述操作的时间复杂度access, search insert and remove 下面的数据结构:StackQueueLinked ListBinary Search Tree以下算法的最好，最差和平均情况的复杂度是什么?:QuicksortMergesortBucket SortRadix Sort  高级解释什么是装饰器你能展示如何编写和使用装饰器吗?编写脚本来确定给定端口上是否可以访问给定主机这个查询熟悉数据类吗？ 你能解释一下他们是干什么用的吗?解释一下上下文管理解释一下缓冲协议解释一下描述符你有抓取网络（爬虫）的经验吗？ 你能描述一下你用过什么以及用什么?你可以在Python中实现链接链表吗?你已经创建了一个网页，用户可以在其中上传文档。 但是，根据文档大小，读取上传文件的功能会运行很长时间，并且用户必须等待读取操作完成才能继续使用该网站。 你怎么能解决这个问题?Prometheus初级什么是Prometheus?

This was my master's thesis.SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.Video demonstration (click the picture):Papers implementedURLDesignationTitleImplementation source1806.04558SV2TTSTransfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech SynthesisThis repo1802.08435WaveRNN (vocoder)Efficient Neural Audio Synthesisfatchord/WaveRNN1703.10135Tacotron (synthesizer)Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesisfatchord/WaveRNN1710.10467GE2E (encoder)Generalized End-To-End Loss for Speaker VerificationThis repoHeads upLike everything else in Deep Learning, this repo is quickly getting old. Many other open-source repositories or SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository will. If you care about the fidelity of the voice you're cloning, and its expressivity, here are some personal recommendations of alternative voice cloning solutions:Check out CoquiTTS for an open source repository that is more up-to-date, with a better voice cloning quality and more functionalities.Check out paperswithcode for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.Check out Resemble.ai (disclaimer: I work there) for state of the art voice cloning with little hassle.Setup1. Install RequirementsBoth Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using venv, but this is optional.Install ffmpeg. This is necessary for reading audio files.Install PyTorch. Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.Install the remaining requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt2. (Optional) Download Pretrained ModelsPretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn't work for you, you can manually download them here.3. (Optional) Test ConfigurationBefore you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:python demo_cli.pyIf all tests pass, you're good to go.4. (Optional) Download DatasetsFor playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading LibriSpeech/train-clean-100. Extract the contents as <datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100 where <datasets_root> is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.5. Launch the ToolboxYou can then try the toolbox:python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>orpython demo_toolbox.pydepending on whether you downloaded any datasets.

DevOps 帮助我们完成什么?DevOps 的反模式是什么?什么是持续集成?开发人员经常将代码集成到共享仓库中的一种开发实践。 它的范围可以从每天或每周进行几次更改，到大规模在一个小时内进行几次更改。验证每段代码（更改/补丁），以使更改可以安全地合并。 如今，使用自动构建来确保代码可以集成的测试更改是一种常见的做法。 它可以是一个运行在不同级别（单元，功能等）的多个测试的构建，也可以是所有或某些必须通过以将更改合并到存储库中的多个单独的构建。什么是持续部署?什么是持续交付?你认为CI / CD的最佳做法是什么?你将用于以下哪些系统和/或工具？：CI/CD基础架构配置管理监控 & 报警日志代码审查代码覆盖率测试集CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis基础架构 - Terraform, CloudFormation配置管理 - Ansible, Puppet, Chef监控 & 报警 - Prometheus, Nagios日志 - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd代码审查 - Gerrit, Review Board代码覆盖率 - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo测试集 - Robot, Serenity, Gauge你在选择工具/技术时是怎么考虑的?你可以使用以下一项或全部：   * 成熟与尖端   * 社区规模   * 体系结构方面-代理与无代理，主控与无主控等解释可变基础架构与不变基础架构在可变的基础架构原则中，更改将应用到现有基础架构之上并随着时间的推移而变化基础架构建立了变化的历史。 Ansible，Puppet和Chef这些工具遵循可变的基础架构原则。在不变的基础架构原则中，每项更改实际上都是新的基础架构。 所以改变到服务器将导致新服务器而不是更新服务器。 Terraform是遵循不变的基础架构原则的一个例子。你熟悉什么方式来交付软件?  * 存档 - 将你所有的应用文件收集到一个存档中（例如tar），并将其交付给用户。  * 打包 - 取决于操作系统，你可以使用OS软件包格式（例如，在RHEL / Fefodra中为RPM）来交付软件，并使用标准打包程序命令来安装，卸载和更新它  * 映像 - VM或容器映像，其中包已包含在其中，以便成功运行。什么是缓存? 缓存是怎么工作的? 为什么缓存很重要?解释一下无状态和有状态什么是HTTP及其工作方式?描述一下设置某些类型的Web服务器的工作流程 (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)解释一下监控. 它是什么?

它为什么如此重要?解释一下递归解释一下什么是设计模式，并详细描述其中的三个解释 big O 符号Strings用你想要的任何语言，编写一个函数来确定给定的字符串是否是回文串高级给定3种设计模式。 你知道如何以你选择的任何语言实现（提供示例）这些设计模式?Python初级Python编程语言的一些特点是什么?1. 这是一种由 Guido Van Rosum 于1991年创建的高级通用编程语言。2. 语言被解释为CPython（用C语言编写）最常用/维护的实现。3. 它是强类型的。 类型系统是鸭子类型和渐进式的。4. Python注重可读性，并使用空格/缩进代替括号{}5. python 包管理器称为PIP“ pip install packages”，具有超过200.000可用的软件包。6. Python 附带安装了pip和一个大的标准库，为程序员提供了许多预置的解决方案。7. 在python中，“一切”都是一个对象。还有许多其他特性，但这是每个python程序员都应该知道的主要特性。Python支持哪些数据类型，哪些是可变的？ 如何显示某个数据类型是可变的?可变数据类型是:ListDictionarySet不可变数据类型是:Numbers (int, float, ...)StringBoolTupleFrozenset通常，你可以使用函数hash（）来检查对象的可变性，如果它是可哈希的，则是不可变的，尽管由于用户定义的对象可能是可变的且可哈希的，所以它并不总是按预期工作什么是PEP8? 举例说明3种风格指南PEP8是Python的编码约定和样式指南的列表5 种样式指南:将所有行限制为最多79个字符。用两个空行包围顶级函数和类定义。制作一个元素的元组时使用逗号使用空格（而不是制表符）进行缩进每个缩进级别使用4个空格解释一下继承以及如何在Python中使用它根据定义，继承是一种机制，其中一个对象充当另一个对象的基础，并保留其所有对象属性。因此，如果B类继承自A类，那么A类的每个特征也将在B类中提供。A类将是“基类”，B类将是“派生类”。当你有几个共享相同功能的类时，这很方便。基本语法:class Base: passclass Derived(Base): passA more forged example:class Animal:    def __init__(self):        print(\""and I'm alive!\"")    def eat(self, food):        print(\""ñom ñom ñom\"", food)class Human(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is ', name)        super().__init__()    def write_poem(self):        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')class Dog(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is', name)        super().__init__()    def bark(self):        print('woof woof')michael = Human('Michael')michael.eat('Spam')michael.write_poem()bruno = Dog('Bruno')bruno.eat('bone')bruno.bark()>>> My name is  Michael>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!>>> My name is Bruno>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom bone>>> woof woof调用super（）会调用Base方法，因此，调用super().__init__() 就是调用 Animal__init__。有一个称为 MetaClasses 的更高级的python功能，可帮助程序员直接控制类的创建。 什么是一个错误? 什么是一个异常? 你熟悉哪些异常类型?＃ 请注意，你通常不需要了解编译过程，而只需知道一切都来自哪里＃ 并给出完整的答案表明你真正知道你在说什么。通常，每个编译过程都有两个步骤。    - 分析    - 产生代码.        Analysis can be broken into:        1. 词法分析   (标记源代码)        2. 语法分析 (如果语法正确，请检查标记是否合法，tldr)                          for i in 'foo'                          ^             SyntaxError: invalid syntax                We missed ':'                        3. 语义分析  (上下文分析，合法语法仍然会触发错误，你是否尝试过除以0，哈希可变对象或使用未声明的函数?)                           1/0                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero            这三个分析步骤负责错误处理。        第二步将负责错误，主要是语法错误，这是最常见的错误。    第三步将负责异常。        如我们所见，异常是语义错误，有许多内置的异常：        ImportError        ValueError        KeyError        FileNotFoundError        IndentationError        IndexError        ...        你还可以具有用户定义的异常，这些异常必须直接或间接地从Exception类继承。    常见例子:            class DividedBy2Error(Exception):        def __init__(self, message):            self.message = message            def division(dividend,divisor):        if divisor == 2:            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')        return dividend / divisor        division(100, 2)        >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!解释 异常处理以及如何在Python中使用它编写一个可以恢复字符串的程序（例如，pizza -> azzip）最简单的是 str[::-1] 但不是效率最高的.\""经典\"" 方式:foo = ''for char in 'pizza':    foo = char + foo>> 'azzip'   编写一个函数以返回一个或多个数字的和。 用户将决定要使用多少个数字首先，你询问用户要使用的数字量。 使用while循环，每个循环将amount_of_numbers减1，直到amount_of_numbers变为0。 在while循环中，你想询问用户一个数字，该数字将在每次循环运行时添加一个变量。def return_sum():\tamount_of_numbers = int(input(\""How many numbers? \""))\ttotal_sum = 0\twhile amount_of_numbers != 0:\t\tnum = int(input(\""Input a number. \""))\t\ttotal_sum += num\t\tamount_of_numbers -= 1\treturn total_sum如何将两个排序列表合并为一个排序列表? _ 在 Python 中用于什么?i18n中的翻译查询将最后执行的表达式或语句的结果保存在交互式解释器中。作为通用“可丢弃”变量名。 例如：x，y，_ = get_data（）（使用了x和y，但是由于我们不关心第三个变量，因此我们将其“扔掉了”）。Algorithms Implementation你可以在Python中实现“二分法搜索”吗?Files如何写文件?with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:    file.write(\""My insightful comment\"")如何反转文件?Regex如何在Python中执行与正则表达式相关的操作？ （匹配模式，替代字符串等）使用 re 模式如何用 \""blue\"" 替换字符串 \""green\""?如何找到一个变量中的所有IP地址？ 如何在文件中找到它们?按每个嵌套列表的第二项对列表列表进行排序li = [[1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 9], [4, 2], [4, 5]]sorted(x, key=lambda l: l[1])你可以编写一个函数来打印给定目录中的所有文件吗？ 包括子目录你有下面的列表: [{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]  获取所有的食物类型，最后输出: {'mushrooms', 'goombas', 'turtles'}brothers_menu =  \\[{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]# \""经典\"" 方式def get_food(brothers_menu) -> set:    temp = []    for brother in brothers_menu:        for food in brother['food']:            temp.append(food)    return set(temp)# 一直先行方式 (Using list comprehension)set([food for bro in x for food in bro['food']])什么是List 加强？ 它比典型的循环更好吗？ 为什么？ 你能示范如何使用它吗?怎样反转 string?最简短的方式是: my_string[::-1] 但是这不是效率最高的. 经典方式是:def reverse_string(string):    temp = \""\""    for char in string:        temp =  char + temp    return temp如何按值对字典排序?如何按键对字典排序?解释数据序列化以及如何使用Python执行你如何在Python中处理参数解析?解释什么是GIL什么是迭代器? 为什么使用迭代器?解释以下方法的类型以及如何使用它们:Static methodClass methodinstance method怎样反转 list?空的 return 返回什么?Time Complexity描述操作的时间复杂度access, search insert and remove 下面的数据结构:StackQueueLinked ListBinary Search Tree以下算法的最好，最差和平均情况的复杂度是什么?:QuicksortMergesortBucket SortRadix Sort  高级解释什么是装饰器你能展示如何编写和使用装饰器吗?编写脚本来确定给定端口上是否可以访问给定主机这个查询熟悉数据类吗？ 你能解释一下他们是干什么用的吗?解释一下上下文管理解释一下缓冲协议解释一下描述符你有抓取网络（爬虫）的经验吗？ 你能描述一下你用过什么以及用什么?你可以在Python中实现链接链表吗?你已经创建了一个网页，用户可以在其中上传文档。 但是，根据文档大小，读取上传文件的功能会运行很长时间，并且用户必须等待读取操作完成才能继续使用该网站。 你怎么能解决这个问题?Prometheus初级什么是Prometheus? Prometheus的主要特点是什么?描述 Prometheus 架构和组件你能否将 Prometheus 与其他解决方案（例如InfluxDB）进行比较?什么是an Alert?描述以下Prometheus组件:Prometheus serverPush GatewayAlert Manager负责抓取存储数据的Prometheus服务器推送网关用于短期作业警报管理负责警报 ;）什么是一个实例?

在Go中，我们可以重新声明变量，并且一旦声明就必须使用它.错. 我们不能重新声明变量，必须使用声明的变量。你使用了哪些Go库?应该根据你的使用情况回答此问题，一些示例是：fmt - formatted I/O下面代码块有什么问题? 怎么解决?func main() {    var x float32 = 13.5    var y int    y = x}下面的代码块尝试将整数101转换为字符串，但相反，我们得到“ e”。 这是为什么？ 怎么解决?package mainimport \""fmt\""func main() {    var x int = 101    var y string    y = string(x)    fmt.Println(y)}它看起来在101处设置了什么unicode值，并将其用于将整数转换为字符串。如果要获取“ 101”，则应使用“ strconv” 软件包，然后替换 y = string(x) with y = strconv.Itoa(x)以下代码块什么是错的?:package mainfunc main() {    var x = 2    var y = 3    const someConst = x + y}以下代码块的输出是什么？:package mainimport \""fmt\""const (\tx = iota\ty = iota)const z = iotafunc main() {\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", x)\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", y)\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", z)} _ 在 Go 中的用途是什么?以下代码块的输出是什么？:package mainimport \""fmt\""const (\t_ = iota + 3\tx)func main() {\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", x)}Mongo初级MongoDB有什么优势？ 换句话说，为什么选择 MongoDB 而不选择 NoSQL 的其他实现?SQL和NoSQL之间的区别是什么?主要区别在于SQL数据库是结构化的（数据以带有行和列的表格-像是Excel电子表格表格），而NoSQL是非结构化的，并且数据存储会根据NoSQL DB的设置方式而有所不同，例如作为键值对，面向文档等在哪种情况下，这个查询希望使用 NoSQL/Mongo 而不是SQL?经常变化的异构数据  * 数据一致性和完整性不是重中之重  * 最好，如果数据库需要快速扩展什么是一个文档? 什么是一个集合?什么是一个聚合?那个更好? 嵌入文档还是引用?Queries解释这个查询: db.books.find({\""name\"": /abc/})解释这个查询: db.books.find().sort({x:1})OpenShift初级什么是OpenShift? 你用过吗？ 如果有，是怎样使用的？你能解释一下 OpenShift 和 Kubernetes 之间的区别吗?定义 Pods 以及解释什么是有状态的 pods你熟悉哪些类型的构建策略?解释标签是什么以及它们的用途解释什么是注释以及它们与标签的区别解释什么是Downward APIShell 脚本初级告诉我你使用Shell脚本的经验脚本中的这一行是什么意思?: #!/bin/bash你倾向于在编写的每个脚本中包含什么?对还是错?: 当某个命令行失败时，默认情况下，该脚本将退出并且不会继续运行取决于所使用的语言和设置，例如在Bash中，默认情况下，脚本将继续运行。今天，我们拥有Ansible之类的工具和技术。 为什么还会有人使用Shell脚本?说出下面每个命令的结果是什么：echo $0echo $?echo $$echo $@echo $#你如何调试Shell脚本?如何在Shell脚本中从用户获得输入?解释一下条件语句以及如何使用它们什么是循环? 你熟悉哪些类型的循环?解释 continue 和 break. 你什么时候使用它们?如何将命令的输出存储在变量中?你如何检查可变长度?单引号和双引号之间的区别是什么?高级解释以下代码::(){ :|:& };:你能举一些Bash最佳实践的例子吗?什么是三元运算符？ 你如何在bash中使用它?使用 if/else 的一种简短方法。 一个例子:[[ $a = 1 ]] && b=\""yes, equal\"" || b=\""nope\""SQL初级SQL 代表什么?Structured Query Language（结构化查询语言）SQL 和 NoSQL 有那些不同主要区别在于SQL数据库是结构化的（数据以带有行和列的表格-像是Excel电子表格表格），而NoSQL是非结构化的，并且数据存储会根据NoSQL DB的设置方式而有所不同，例如作为键值对，面向文档等数据库符合ACID的含义是什么?ACID代表原子性，一致性，隔离性，耐久性。为了符合ACID，数据库必须满足四个标准中的每个标准原子性 - 数据库发生更改时，它整体上应该成功或失败。例如，如果你要更新表，则更新应完全执行。如果仅部分执行，则更新被视为整体失败，并且不会通过-数据库将恢复为原始状态更新发生之前的状态。还应该提到的是，原子性确保每个事务以其自身的独立“单元”完成 - 如果任何部分失败，则整个语句都会失败。一致性 - 对数据库所做的任何更改都应将其从一种有效状态转变为另一种有效状态。例如，如果你对数据库进行了更改，则不应破坏它。通过检查和约束来保持一致性在数据库中预定义。例如，如果你尝试将列的值从字符串更改为int应该是数据类型字符串，一致的数据库将不允许该事务通过，并且该操作将不执行隔离 - 确保数据库不会被“更新中”-因为多个事务正在运行同时，它仍应保持数据库处于与按顺序运行事务相同的状态。例如，假设有20个人同时对数据库进行了更改。在当你执行查询时，已完成20项更改中的15项，但仍有5项正在进行中。你应该仅看到已完成的15个更改 - 随着更改的进行，你将看不到数据库的更新中。耐用性 - 更改一旦提交，无论发生什么情况都将保持提交状态（电源故障，系统崩溃等）。这意味着所有已完成的交易必须记录在非挥发性内存中。请注意，SQL本质上符合ACID。某些NoSQL DB可能符合ACID，具体取决于它们的工作方式，但是根据一般经验，NoSQL DB不被视为符合ACID什么时候最好使用SQL/NoSQL？SQL - 当数据完整性至关重要时，最适合使用。 由于符合ACID，SQL通常由许多业务实现特别是金融领域。NoSQL - 非常适合你需要快速扩展的情况。 请记住NoSQL是为Web应用程序设计的，如果你需要快速将相同信息散布到多台服务器，它将会很好的用此外，由于 NoSQL 不遵守具有列和行结构的严格表关系数据库所要求的，你可以将不同的数据类型存储在一起。什么是笛卡尔积?笛卡尔积是指第一个表中的所有行都与第二个表中的所有行连接在一起时的结果表。 这可以通过不定义要联接的键来隐式完成，也可以通过以下方式显式地完成：在两个表上调用CROSS JOIN，如下所示：Select * from customers CROSS JOIN orders;请注意，笛卡尔积也可能是一件坏事 - 执行联接时在两个都没有唯一键的表上，这可能会导致返回信息是不正确的。SQL Specific Questions对于这些问题，我们将使用下面显示的“客户和订单”表：CustomersCustomer_IDCustomer_NameItems_in_cartCash_spent_to_Date100204John Smith020.00100205Jane Smith340.00100206Bobby Frank1100.20ORDERSCustomer_IDOrder_IDItemPriceDate_sold100206A123Rubber Ducky2.202019-09-18100206A123Bubble Bath8.002019-09-18100206Q98780-Pack TP90.002019-09-20100205Z001Cat Food - Tuna Fish10.002019-08-05100205Z001Cat Food - Chicken10.002019-08-05100205Z001Cat Food - Beef10.002019-08-05100205Z001Cat Food - Kitty quesadilla10.002019-08-05100204X202Coffee20.002019-04-29我如何从该表中选择所有字段?Select * From Customers;约翰的购物车中有几件？Select Items_in_cart From Customers Where Customer_Name = \""John Smith\"";所有客户花费的所有现金的总和是多少?Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH From Customers;在购物车有商品的有多少人?Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items From Customers where Items_in_cart > 0;你如何将客户表加入订单表?你可以加入他们的唯一键。 在这种情况下，唯一键为中的Customer_ID客户表和订单表你如何显示哪些客户订购了哪些物品?Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item From Customers c Left Join Orders o On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;高级使用with语句，你将如何显示谁订购了猫粮以及花费的总金额?with cat_food as ( Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE From Orders Where Item like \""%Cat Food%\"" Group by Customer_ID ) Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE From Customers c Inner JOIN cat_food f ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);尽管这是一个简单的声明，但“ with”子句在在连接到另一个表之前，需要在一个表上运行一个复杂的查询。 用语句很好，因为你在运行查询时会创建一个伪临时文件，而不是创建一个新表。目前尚无法获得所有猫粮的总和，因此我们使用了with语句来创建伪表检索每个客户花费的价格总和，然后正常加入该表。Azure初级解释一下可用性集和可用性区域什么是Azure资源管理器？ 你可以描述ARM模板的格式吗？解释一下Azure托管磁盘GCP初级GCP的主要组件和服务是什么?你熟悉哪些GCP管理工具?告诉我对GCP联网了解多少OpenStack初级告诉我你使用OpenStack的经验。 你认为OpenStack的优缺点是什么?你熟悉OpenStack的哪些组件/项目?你能告诉我以下每个组件/项目负责什么吗?:NovaNeutronCinderGlanceKeystone详细描述如何使用可以从云外部访问的IP来启动实例你收到客户打来的电话，说：“我可以ping我的实例，但不能连接（ssh）它”。 可能是什么问题？OpenStack支持哪些类型的网络？你如何调试OpenStack存储问题？ （工具，日志等）你如何调试OpenStack计算问题？ （工具，日志等）你熟悉 TripleO吗?

28,CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning,https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/blob/master/README.md,Python,"Real-Time Voice CloningThis repository is an implementation of Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification toMultispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. This was my master's thesis.SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.Video demonstration (click the picture):Papers implementedURLDesignationTitleImplementation source1806.04558SV2TTSTransfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech SynthesisThis repo1802.08435WaveRNN (vocoder)Efficient Neural Audio Synthesisfatchord/WaveRNN1703.10135Tacotron (synthesizer)Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesisfatchord/WaveRNN1710.10467GE2E (encoder)Generalized End-To-End Loss for Speaker VerificationThis repoHeads upLike everything else in Deep Learning, this repo is quickly getting old. Many other open-source repositories or SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository will. If you care about the fidelity of the voice you're cloning, and its expressivity, here are some personal recommendations of alternative voice cloning solutions:Check out CoquiTTS for an open source repository that is more up-to-date, with a better voice cloning quality and more functionalities.Check out paperswithcode for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.Check out Resemble.ai (disclaimer: I work there) for state of the art voice cloning with little hassle.Setup1. Install RequirementsBoth Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using venv, but this is optional.Install ffmpeg. This is necessary for reading audio files.Install PyTorch. Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.Install the remaining requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt2. (Optional) Download Pretrained ModelsPretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn't work for you, you can manually download them here.3. (Optional) Test ConfigurationBefore you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:python demo_cli.pyIf all tests pass, you're good to go.4. (Optional) Download DatasetsFor playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading LibriSpeech/train-clean-100. Extract the contents as <datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100 where <datasets_root> is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.5. Launch the ToolboxYou can then try the toolbox:python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>orpython demo_toolbox.pydepending on whether you downloaded any datasets. If you are running an X-server or if you have the error Aborted (core dumped), see this issue."

Having both a Ph.D. degree in applied math and a Kaggle Competitions Master tier, Yury aimed at designing an ML course with a perfect balance between theory and practice. Thus, the course meets you with math formulae in lectures, and a lot of practice in a form of assignments and  Kaggle Inclass competitions. Currently, the course is in a self-paced mode. Here we guide you through the self-paced mlcourse.ai.Bonus:Additionally, you can purchase a Bonus Assignments pack with the best non-demo versions of mlcourse.ai assignments. Select the \""Bonus Assignments\"" tier. Refer to the details of the deal on the main page mlcourse.ai.Mirrors (🇬🇧-only): mlcourse.ai (main site), Kaggle Dataset (same notebooks as Kaggle Notebooks)Self-paced passingYou are guided through 10 weeks of mlcourse.ai. For each week, from Pandas to Gradient Boosting, instructions are given on which articles to read, lectures to watch, what assignments to accomplish.ArticlesThis is the list of published articles on medium.com 🇬🇧, habr.com 🇷🇺.

The idea is that you pay for ~1-5 months while studying the course materials, but a single contribution is still fine and opens your access to the bonus pack.Note: the first payment is charged at the moment of joining the Tier Patreon, and the next payment is charged on the 1st day of the next month, thus it's better to purchase the pack in the 1st half of the month.mlcourse.ai is never supposed to go fully monetized (it's created in the wonderful open ODS.ai community and will remain open and free) but it'd help to cover some operational costs, and Yury also put in quite some effort into assembling all the best assignments into one pack. Please note that unlike the rest of the course content, Bonus Assignments are copyrighted. Informally, Yury's fine if you share the pack with 2-3 friends but public sharing of the Bonus Assignments pack is prohibited.  The bonus pack contains 10 assignments, in some of them you are challenged to beat a baseline in a Kaggle competition under thorough guidance (\""Alice\"" and \""Medium\"") or implement an algorithm from scratch -- efficient stochastic gradient descent classifier and gradient boosting.Kaggle competitionsCatch Me If You Can: Intruder Detection through Webpage Session Tracking.

DevOps 帮助我们完成什么?DevOps 的反模式是什么?什么是持续集成?开发人员经常将代码集成到共享仓库中的一种开发实践。 它的范围可以从每天或每周进行几次更改，到大规模在一个小时内进行几次更改。验证每段代码（更改/补丁），以使更改可以安全地合并。 如今，使用自动构建来确保代码可以集成的测试更改是一种常见的做法。 它可以是一个运行在不同级别（单元，功能等）的多个测试的构建，也可以是所有或某些必须通过以将更改合并到存储库中的多个单独的构建。什么是持续部署?什么是持续交付?你认为CI / CD的最佳做法是什么?你将用于以下哪些系统和/或工具？：CI/CD基础架构配置管理监控 & 报警日志代码审查代码覆盖率测试集CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis基础架构 - Terraform, CloudFormation配置管理 - Ansible, Puppet, Chef监控 & 报警 - Prometheus, Nagios日志 - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd代码审查 - Gerrit, Review Board代码覆盖率 - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo测试集 - Robot, Serenity, Gauge你在选择工具/技术时是怎么考虑的?你可以使用以下一项或全部：   * 成熟与尖端   * 社区规模   * 体系结构方面-代理与无代理，主控与无主控等解释可变基础架构与不变基础架构在可变的基础架构原则中，更改将应用到现有基础架构之上并随着时间的推移而变化基础架构建立了变化的历史。 Ansible，Puppet和Chef这些工具遵循可变的基础架构原则。在不变的基础架构原则中，每项更改实际上都是新的基础架构。 所以改变到服务器将导致新服务器而不是更新服务器。 Terraform是遵循不变的基础架构原则的一个例子。你熟悉什么方式来交付软件?  * 存档 - 将你所有的应用文件收集到一个存档中（例如tar），并将其交付给用户。  * 打包 - 取决于操作系统，你可以使用OS软件包格式（例如，在RHEL / Fefodra中为RPM）来交付软件，并使用标准打包程序命令来安装，卸载和更新它  * 映像 - VM或容器映像，其中包已包含在其中，以便成功运行。什么是缓存? 缓存是怎么工作的? 为什么缓存很重要?解释一下无状态和有状态什么是HTTP及其工作方式?描述一下设置某些类型的Web服务器的工作流程 (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)解释一下监控. 它是什么?

Python注重可读性，并使用空格/缩进代替括号{}5. python 包管理器称为PIP“ pip install packages”，具有超过200.000可用的软件包。6. Python 附带安装了pip和一个大的标准库，为程序员提供了许多预置的解决方案。7. 在python中，“一切”都是一个对象。还有许多其他特性，但这是每个python程序员都应该知道的主要特性。Python支持哪些数据类型，哪些是可变的？ 如何显示某个数据类型是可变的?可变数据类型是:ListDictionarySet不可变数据类型是:Numbers (int, float, ...)StringBoolTupleFrozenset通常，你可以使用函数hash（）来检查对象的可变性，如果它是可哈希的，则是不可变的，尽管由于用户定义的对象可能是可变的且可哈希的，所以它并不总是按预期工作什么是PEP8? 举例说明3种风格指南PEP8是Python的编码约定和样式指南的列表5 种样式指南:将所有行限制为最多79个字符。用两个空行包围顶级函数和类定义。制作一个元素的元组时使用逗号使用空格（而不是制表符）进行缩进每个缩进级别使用4个空格解释一下继承以及如何在Python中使用它根据定义，继承是一种机制，其中一个对象充当另一个对象的基础，并保留其所有对象属性。因此，如果B类继承自A类，那么A类的每个特征也将在B类中提供。A类将是“基类”，B类将是“派生类”。当你有几个共享相同功能的类时，这很方便。基本语法:class Base: passclass Derived(Base): passA more forged example:class Animal:    def __init__(self):        print(\""and I'm alive!\"")    def eat(self, food):        print(\""ñom ñom ñom\"", food)class Human(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is ', name)        super().__init__()    def write_poem(self):        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')class Dog(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is', name)        super().__init__()    def bark(self):        print('woof woof')michael = Human('Michael')michael.eat('Spam')michael.write_poem()bruno = Dog('Bruno')bruno.eat('bone')bruno.bark()>>> My name is  Michael>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!>>> My name is Bruno>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom bone>>> woof woof调用super（）会调用Base方法，因此，调用super().__init__() 就是调用 Animal__init__。有一个称为 MetaClasses 的更高级的python功能，可帮助程序员直接控制类的创建。 什么是一个错误? 什么是一个异常? 你熟悉哪些异常类型?＃ 请注意，你通常不需要了解编译过程，而只需知道一切都来自哪里＃ 并给出完整的答案表明你真正知道你在说什么。通常，每个编译过程都有两个步骤。    - 分析    - 产生代码.        Analysis can be broken into:        1. 词法分析   (标记源代码)        2. 语法分析 (如果语法正确，请检查标记是否合法，tldr)                          for i in 'foo'                          ^             SyntaxError: invalid syntax                We missed ':'                        3. 语义分析  (上下文分析，合法语法仍然会触发错误，你是否尝试过除以0，哈希可变对象或使用未声明的函数?)                           1/0                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero            这三个分析步骤负责错误处理。        第二步将负责错误，主要是语法错误，这是最常见的错误。    第三步将负责异常。        如我们所见，异常是语义错误，有许多内置的异常：        ImportError        ValueError        KeyError        FileNotFoundError        IndentationError        IndexError        ...        你还可以具有用户定义的异常，这些异常必须直接或间接地从Exception类继承。    常见例子:            class DividedBy2Error(Exception):        def __init__(self, message):            self.message = message            def division(dividend,divisor):        if divisor == 2:            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')        return dividend / divisor        division(100, 2)        >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!解释 异常处理以及如何在Python中使用它编写一个可以恢复字符串的程序（例如，pizza -> azzip）最简单的是 str[::-1] 但不是效率最高的.\""经典\"" 方式:foo = ''for char in 'pizza':    foo = char + foo>> 'azzip'   编写一个函数以返回一个或多个数字的和。 用户将决定要使用多少个数字首先，你询问用户要使用的数字量。 使用while循环，每个循环将amount_of_numbers减1，直到amount_of_numbers变为0。 在while循环中，你想询问用户一个数字，该数字将在每次循环运行时添加一个变量。def return_sum():\tamount_of_numbers = int(input(\""How many numbers? \""))\ttotal_sum = 0\twhile amount_of_numbers != 0:\t\tnum = int(input(\""Input a number. \""))\t\ttotal_sum += num\t\tamount_of_numbers -= 1\treturn total_sum如何将两个排序列表合并为一个排序列表? _ 在 Python 中用于什么?i18n中的翻译查询将最后执行的表达式或语句的结果保存在交互式解释器中。作为通用“可丢弃”变量名。 例如：x，y，_ = get_data（）（使用了x和y，但是由于我们不关心第三个变量，因此我们将其“扔掉了”）。Algorithms Implementation你可以在Python中实现“二分法搜索”吗?Files如何写文件?with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:    file.write(\""My insightful comment\"")如何反转文件?Regex如何在Python中执行与正则表达式相关的操作？ （匹配模式，替代字符串等）使用 re 模式如何用 \""blue\"" 替换字符串 \""green\""?如何找到一个变量中的所有IP地址？ 如何在文件中找到它们?按每个嵌套列表的第二项对列表列表进行排序li = [[1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 9], [4, 2], [4, 5]]sorted(x, key=lambda l: l[1])你可以编写一个函数来打印给定目录中的所有文件吗？ 包括子目录你有下面的列表: [{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]  获取所有的食物类型，最后输出: {'mushrooms', 'goombas', 'turtles'}brothers_menu =  \\[{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]# \""经典\"" 方式def get_food(brothers_menu) -> set:    temp = []    for brother in brothers_menu:        for food in brother['food']:            temp.append(food)    return set(temp)# 一直先行方式 (Using list comprehension)set([food for bro in x for food in bro['food']])什么是List 加强？ 它比典型的循环更好吗？ 为什么？ 你能示范如何使用它吗?怎样反转 string?最简短的方式是: my_string[::-1] 但是这不是效率最高的. 经典方式是:def reverse_string(string):    temp = \""\""    for char in string:        temp =  char + temp    return temp如何按值对字典排序?如何按键对字典排序?解释数据序列化以及如何使用Python执行你如何在Python中处理参数解析?解释什么是GIL什么是迭代器? 为什么使用迭代器?解释以下方法的类型以及如何使用它们:Static methodClass methodinstance method怎样反转 list?空的 return 返回什么?Time Complexity描述操作的时间复杂度access, search insert and remove 下面的数据结构:StackQueueLinked ListBinary Search Tree以下算法的最好，最差和平均情况的复杂度是什么?:QuicksortMergesortBucket SortRadix Sort  高级解释什么是装饰器你能展示如何编写和使用装饰器吗?编写脚本来确定给定端口上是否可以访问给定主机这个查询熟悉数据类吗？ 你能解释一下他们是干什么用的吗?解释一下上下文管理解释一下缓冲协议解释一下描述符你有抓取网络（爬虫）的经验吗？ 你能描述一下你用过什么以及用什么?你可以在Python中实现链接链表吗?你已经创建了一个网页，用户可以在其中上传文档。 但是，根据文档大小，读取上传文件的功能会运行很长时间，并且用户必须等待读取操作完成才能继续使用该网站。 你怎么能解决这个问题?Prometheus初级什么是Prometheus?

This was my master's thesis.SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.Video demonstration (click the picture):Papers implementedURLDesignationTitleImplementation source1806.04558SV2TTSTransfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech SynthesisThis repo1802.08435WaveRNN (vocoder)Efficient Neural Audio Synthesisfatchord/WaveRNN1703.10135Tacotron (synthesizer)Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesisfatchord/WaveRNN1710.10467GE2E (encoder)Generalized End-To-End Loss for Speaker VerificationThis repoHeads upLike everything else in Deep Learning, this repo is quickly getting old. Many other open-source repositories or SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository will. If you care about the fidelity of the voice you're cloning, and its expressivity, here are some personal recommendations of alternative voice cloning solutions:Check out CoquiTTS for an open source repository that is more up-to-date, with a better voice cloning quality and more functionalities.Check out paperswithcode for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.Check out Resemble.ai (disclaimer: I work there) for state of the art voice cloning with little hassle.Setup1. Install RequirementsBoth Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using venv, but this is optional.Install ffmpeg. This is necessary for reading audio files.Install PyTorch. Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.Install the remaining requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt2. (Optional) Download Pretrained ModelsPretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn't work for you, you can manually download them here.3. (Optional) Test ConfigurationBefore you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:python demo_cli.pyIf all tests pass, you're good to go.4. (Optional) Download DatasetsFor playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading LibriSpeech/train-clean-100. Extract the contents as <datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100 where <datasets_root> is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.5. Launch the ToolboxYou can then try the toolbox:python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>orpython demo_toolbox.pydepending on whether you downloaded any datasets.

自分で会話を組み立てることを求められます。以下のステップに従って議論を組み立てることができるでしょう。この過程を確かなものにするために、次のセクションシステム設計課題例とその解答 を以下の指針に従って読み込むといいでしょう。ステップ 1: そのシステム使用例の概要、制約、推計値等を聞き出し、まとめるシステム仕様の要求事項を聞き出し、問題箇所を特定しましょう。使用例と制約を明確にするための質問を投げかけましょう。要求する推計値についても議論しておきましょう。誰がそのサービスを使うのか？どのように使うのか？何人のユーザーがいるのか？システムはどのような機能を果たすのか？システムへの入力と出力は？どれだけの容量のデータを捌く必要があるのか？一秒間に何リクエストの送信が想定されるか？読み書き比率の推定値はいくら程度か？ステップ 2: より高レベルのシステム設計を組み立てる重要なコンポーネントを全て考慮した高レベルのシステム設計概要を組み立てる。主要なコンポーネントと接続をスケッチして書き出す考えの裏付けをするステップ 3:

であると言えるでしょう。一般的に、パフォーマンスを向上させるというのはすなわち計算処理を増やすことを意味しますが、データセットが増えた時などより大きな処理を捌けるようになることでもあります。1パフォーマンスvsスケーラビリティをとらえる他の考え方:パフォーマンス での問題を抱えている時、あなたのシステムは一人のユーザーにとって遅いと言えるでしょう。スケーラビリティ での問題を抱えているとき、一人のユーザーにとっては速いですが、多くのリクエストがある時には遅くなってしまうでしょう。その他の参考資料、ページスケーラビリティについてスケーラビリティ、可用性、安定性、パターンレイテンシー vs スループットレイテンシー とはなにがしかの動作を行う、もしくは結果を算出するのに要する時間スループット とはそのような動作や結果算出が単位時間に行われる回数一般的に、

全ての読み込みは最新の書き込みもしくはエラーを受け取る可用性 - 受け取る情報が最新のものだという保証はないが、全てのリクエストはレスポンスを必ず受け取る分断耐性 - ネットワーク問題によって順不同の分断が起きてもシステムが動作を続けるネットワークは信頼できないので、分断耐性は必ず保証しなければなりません。つまりソフトウェアシステムとしてのトレードオフは、一貫性を取るか、可用性を取るかを考えなければなりません。CP - 一貫性と分断耐性(consistency and partition tolerance)分断されたノードからのレスポンスを待ち続けているとタイムアウトエラーに陥る可能性があります。CPはあなたのサービスがアトミックな読み書き（不可分操作）を必要とする際にはいい選択肢でしょう。AP - 可用性と分断耐性(availability and partition tolerance)レスポンスはノード上にあるデータで最新のものを返します。つまり、最新版のデータが返されるとは限りません。分断が解消された後も、書き込みが反映されるのには時間がかかります。結果整合性　を求めるサービスの際にはAPを採用するのがいいでしょう。もしくは、外部エラーに関わらずシステムが稼働する必要がある際にも同様です。その他の参考資料、ページCAP 理論を振り返る平易な英語でのCAP 理論のイントロCAP FAQ一貫性パターン同じデータの複製が複数ある状態では、クライアントが一貫したデータ表示を受け取るために、どのようにそれらを同期すればいいのかという課題があります。 CAP 理論 における一貫性の定義を思い出してみましょう。全ての読み取りは最新の書き込みデータもしくはエラーを受け取るはずです。弱い一貫性書き込み後の読み取りでは、その最新の書き込みを読めたり読めなかったりする。ベストエフォート型のアプローチに基づく。このアプローチはmemcachedなどのシステムに見られます。弱い一貫性はリアルタイム性が必要なユースケース、例えばVoIP、ビデオチャット、リアルタイムマルチプレイヤーゲームなどと相性がいいでしょう。例えば、電話に出ているときに数秒間音声が受け取れなくなったとしたら、その後に接続が回復してもその接続が切断されていた間に話されていたことは聞き取れないというような感じです。結果整合性書き込みの後、読み取りは最終的にはその結果を読み取ることができる(ミリ秒ほど遅れてというのが一般的です)。データは非同期的に複製されます。このアプローチはDNSやメールシステムなどに採用されています。結果整合性は多くのリクエストを捌くサービスと相性がいいでしょう。強い一貫性書き込みの後、読み取りはそれを必ず読むことができます。データは同期的に複製されます。このアプローチはファイルシステムやRDBMSなどで採用されています。トランザクションを扱うサービスでは強い一貫性が必要でしょう。その他の参考資料、ページデータセンター間でのトランザクション可用性パターン高い可用性を担保するには主に次の二つのパターンがあります: フェイルオーバー と レプリケーション です。フェイルオーバーアクティブ・パッシブアクティブ・パッシブフェイルオーバーにおいては、周期信号はアクティブもしくはスタンバイ中のパッシブなサーバーに送られます。周期信号が中断された時には、パッシブだったサーバーがアクティブサーバーのIPアドレスを引き継いでサービスを再開します。起動までのダウンタイムはパッシブサーバーが「ホット」なスタンバイ状態にあるか、「コールド」なスタンバイ状態にあるかで変わります。アクティブなサーバーのみがトラフィックを捌きます。アクティブ・パッシブフェイルオーバーはマスター・スレーブフェイルオーバーと呼ばれることもあります。アクティブ・アクティブアクティブアクティブ構成では両方のサーバーがトラフィックを捌くことで負荷を分散します。これらのサーバーがパブリックなものの場合、DNSは両方のサーバーのパブリックIPを知っている必要があります。もし、プライベートなものな場合、アプリケーションロジックが両方のサーバーの情報について知っている必要があります。アクティブ・アクティブなフェイルオーバーはマスター・マスターフェイルオーバーと呼ばれることもあります。短所: フェイルオーバーフェイルオーバーではより多くのハードウェアを要し、複雑さが増します。最新の書き込みがパッシブサーバーに複製される前にアクティブが落ちると、データ欠損が起きる潜在可能性があります。レプリケーションマスター・スレーブ　と　マスター・マスターこのトピックは データベース セクションにおいてより詳細に解説されています:マスター・スレーブ レプリケーションマスター・マスター レプリケーションドメインネームシステム      Source: DNS security presentationドメインネームシステム (DNS) は www.example.com などのドメインネームをIPアドレスへと翻訳します。DNSは少数のオーソライズされたサーバーが上位に位置する階層的構造です。あなたのルーターもしくはISPは検索をする際にどのDNSサーバーに接続するかという情報を提供します。低い階層のDNSサーバーはその経路マップをキャッシュします。ただ、この情報は伝搬遅延によって陳腐化する可能性があります。DNSの結果はあなたのブラウザもしくはOSに一定期間（time to live (TTL)に設定された期間）キャッシュされます。NS record (name server) - あなたのドメイン・サブドメインでのDNSサーバーを特定します。MX record (mail exchange) - メッセージを受け取るメールサーバーを特定します。A record (address) - IPアドレスに名前をつけます。CNAME (canonical) - 他の名前もしくは　CNAME (example.com を www.example.com) もしくは A recordへと名前を指し示す。CloudFlare や Route 53

アーキテクチャWikipediaDNS 記事コンテンツデリバリーネットワーク(Content delivery network)      Source: Why use a CDNコンテンツデリバリーネットワーク(CDN)は世界中に配置されたプロキシサーバーのネットワークがユーザーに一番地理的に近いサーバーからコンテンツを配信するシステムのことです。AmazonのCloudFrontなどは例外的にダイナミックなコンテンツも配信しますが、一般的に、HTML/CSS/JS、写真、そして動画などの静的ファイルがCDNを通じて配信されます。そのサイトのDNSがクライアントにどのサーバーと交信するかという情報を伝えます。CDNを用いてコンテンツを配信することで以下の二つの理由でパフォーマンスが劇的に向上します:ユーザーは近くにあるデータセンターから受信できるバックエンドサーバーはCDNが処理してくれるリクエストに関しては処理する必要がなくなりますプッシュCDNプッシュCDNではサーバーデータに更新があった時には必ず、新しいコンテンツを受け取る方式です。コンテンツを用意し、CDNに直接アップロードし、URLをCDNを指すように指定するところまで、全て自分で責任を負う形です。コンテンツがいつ期限切れになるのか更新されるのかを設定することができます。コンテンツは新規作成時、更新時のみアップロードされることでトラフィックは最小化される一方、ストレージは最大限消費されてしまいます。トラフィックの少ない、もしくは頻繁にはコンテンツが更新されないサイトの場合にはプッシュCDNと相性がいいでしょう。コンテンツは定期的に再びプルされるのではなく、CDNに一度のみ配置されます。プルCDNプルCDNでは一人目のユーザーがリクエストした時に、新しいコンテンツをサービスのサーバーから取得します。コンテンツは自分のサーバーに保存して、CDNを指すURLを書き換えます。結果として、CDNにコンテンツがキャッシュされるまではリクエスト処理が遅くなります。time-to-live (TTL) はコンテンツがどれだけの期間キャッシュされるかを規定します。プルCDNはCDN 上でのストレージスペースを最小化しますが、有効期限が切れたファイルが更新前にプルされてしまうことで冗長なトラフィックに繋がってしまう可能性があります。大規模なトラフィックのあるサイトではプルCDNが相性がいいでしょう。というのも、トラフィックの大部分は最近リクエストされ、CDNに残っているコンテンツにアクセスするものであることが多いからです。欠点: CDNCDNのコストはトラフィック量によって変わります。もちろん、CDNを使わない場合のコストと比較するべきでしょう。TTLが切れる前にコンテンツが更新されると陳腐化する恐れがあります。CDNでは静的コンテンツがCDNを指すようにURLを更新する必要があります。その他の参考資料、ページグローバルに分散されたコンテンツデリバリーネットワークプッシュCDNとプルCDNの違いWikipediaロードバランサー      Source: Scalable system design patternsロードバランサーは入力されるクライアントのリクエストをアプリケーションサーバーやデータベースへと分散させる。どのケースでもロードバランサーはサーバー等計算リソースからのレスポンスを適切なクライアントに返す。ロードバランサーは以下のことに効果的です:リクエストが状態の良くないサーバーに行くのを防ぐリクエストを過剰に送るのを防ぐ特定箇所の欠陥でサービスが落ちることを防ぐロードバランサーは (費用の高い) ハードウェアもしくはHAProxyなどのソフトウェアで実現できる。他の利点としては:SSL termination - 入力されるリクエストを解読する、また、サーバーレスポンスを暗号化することでバックエンドのサーバーがこのコストが高くつきがちな処理を請け負わなくていいように肩代わりします。X.509 certificates をそれぞれのサーバーにインストールする必要をなくしますセッション管理 - クッキーを取り扱うウェブアプリがセッション情報を保持していない時などに、特定のクライアントのリクエストを同じインスタンスへと流します。障害に対応するために、アクティブ・パッシブ もしくは アクティブ・アクティブ モードのどちらにおいても、複数のロードバランサーを配置するのが一般的です。ロードバランサーは以下のような種々のメトリックを用いてトラフィックルーティングを行うことができます:ランダムLeast loadedセッション/クッキーラウンドロビンもしくは加重ラウンドロビンLayer 4Layer 7Layer 4 ロードバランシングLayer 4 ロードバランサーは トランスポートレイヤー を参照してどのようにリクエストを配分するか判断します。一般的に、トランスポートレイヤーとしては、ソース、送信先IPアドレス、ヘッダーに記述されたポート番号が含まれますが、パケットの中身のコンテンツは含みません。 Layer 4 ロードバランサーはネットワークパケットを上流サーバーへ届け、上流サーバーから配信することでネットワークアドレス変換 Network Address Translation (NAT) を実現します。Layer 7 ロードバランシングLayer 7 ロードバランサーは アプリケーションレイヤー を参照してどのようにリクエストを配分するか判断します。ヘッダー、メッセージ、クッキーなどのコンテンツのことです。Layer 7 ロードバランサーはネットワークトラフィックの終端を受け持ち メッセージを読み込み、ロードバランシングの判断をし、選択したサーバーとの接続を繋ぎます。例えば layer 7 ロードバランサーは動画のトラフィックを直接、そのデータをホストしているサーバーにつなぐと同時に、決済処理などのより繊細なトラフィックをセキュリティ強化されたサーバーに流すということもできる。柔軟性とのトレードオフになりますが、 layer 4 ロードバランサーではLayer 7ロードバランサーよりも所要時間、計算リソースを少なく済ませることができます。ただし、昨今の汎用ハードウェアではパフォーマンスは最小限のみしか発揮できないでしょう。水平スケーリングロードバランサーでは水平スケーリングによってパフォーマンスと可用性を向上させることができます。手頃な汎用マシンを追加することによってスケールアウトさせる方が、一つのサーバーをより高価なマシンにスケールアップする（垂直スケーリング）より費用対効果も高くなり、結果的に可用性も高くなります。また、汎用ハードウェアを扱える人材を雇う方が、特化型の商用ハードウェアを扱える人材を雇うよりも簡単でしょう。欠点: 水平スケーリング水平的にスケーリングしていくと、複雑さが増す上に、サーバーのクローニングが必要になる。サーバーはステートレスである必要がある: ユーザーに関連するセッションや、プロフィール写真などのデータを持ってはいけないセッションは一元的なデータベース (SQL、 NoSQL)などのデータストアにストアされるか キャッシュ (Redis、 Memcached)に残す必要があります。キャッシュやデータベースなどの下流サーバーは上流サーバーがスケールアウトするにつれてより多くの同時接続を保たなければなりません。欠点: ロードバランサーロードバランサーはリソースが不足していたり、設定が適切でない場合、システム全体のボトルネックになる可能性があります。単一障害点を除こうとしてロードバランサーを導入した結果、複雑さが増してしまうことになります。ロードバランサーが一つだけだとそこが単一障害点になってしまいます。一方で、ロードバランサーを複数にすると、さらに複雑さが増してしまいます。その他の参考資料、ページNGINX

リバースプロキシサーバーは内部サービスをまとめて外部に統一されたインターフェースを提供するウェブサーバーです。クライアントからのリクエストはそれに対応するサーバーに送られて、その後レスポンスをリバースプロキシがクライアントに返します。他には以下のような利点があります:より堅牢なセキュリティ - バックエンドサーバーの情報を隠したり、IPアドレスをブラックリスト化したり、クライアントごとの接続数を制限したりできます。スケーラビリティや柔軟性が増します - クライアントはリバースプロキシのIPしか見ないので、裏でサーバーをスケールしたり、設定を変えやすくなります。SSL termination -

静的コンテンツを直接送信することができます。HTML/CSS/JS写真動画などなどロードバランサー vs リバースプロキシ複数のサーバーがある時にはロードバランサーをデプロイすると役に立つでしょう。 しばしば、ロードバランサーは同じ機能を果たすサーバー群へのトラフィックを捌きます。リバースプロキシでは、上記に述べたような利点を、単一のウェブサーバーやアプリケーションレイヤーに対しても示すことができます。NGINX や HAProxy などの技術はlayer 7 リバースプロキシとロードバランサーの両方をサポートします。欠点: リバースプロキシリバースプロキシを導入するとシステムの複雑性が増します。単一のリバースプロキシは単一障害点になりえます。一方で、複数のリバースプロキシを導入すると(例: フェイルオーバー) 複雑性はより増します。その他の参考資料、ページリバースプロキシ vs ロードバランサーNGINX アーキテクチャHAProxy アーキテクチャ ガイドWikipediaアプリケーション層

では、小さい自律的なサービスが協調して動くように提唱しています。小さいサービスの小さいチームが急成長のためにより積極的な計画を立てられるようにするためです。アプリケーション層は非同期処理もサポートします。マイクロサービス独立してデプロイできる、小規模なモジュール様式であるマイクロサービスもこの議論に関係してくる技術でしょう。それぞれのサービスは独自のプロセスを処理し、明確で軽量なメカニズムで通信して、その目的とする機能を実現します。1例えばPinterestでは以下のようなマイクロサービスに分かれています。ユーザープロフィール、フォロワー、フィード、検索、写真アップロードなどです。サービスディスカバリーConsul、 Etcd、 Zookeeper などのシステムでは、登録されているサービスの名前、アドレス、ポートの情報を監視することで、サービス同士が互いを見つけやすくしています。サービスの完全性の確認には Health checks が便利で、これには HTTP エンドポイントがよく使われます。 Consul と Etcd のいずれも組み込みの key-value store を持っており、設定データや共有データなどのデータを保存しておくことに使われます。欠点: アプリケーション層アーキテクチャ、運用、そしてプロセスを考慮すると、緩く結び付けられたアプリケーション層を追加するには、モノリシックなシステムとは異なるアプローチが必要です。マイクロサービスはデプロイと運用の点から見ると複雑性が増すことになります。その他の参考資料、ページスケールするシステムアーキテクチャを設計するためのイントロシステム設計インタビューを紐解くサービス指向アーキテクチャZookeeperのイントロダクションマイクロサービスを作るために知っておきたいことデータベース

レプリケーション新しいデータ書き込みを複製する前にマスターが落ちた場合にはそのデータが失われてしまう可能性がある。書き込みは読み取りレプリカにおいてリプレイされる。書き込みが多い場合、複製ノードが書き込みの処理のみで行き詰まって、読み取りの処理を満足に行えない可能性がある。読み取りスレーブノードの数が多ければ多いほど、複製しなければならない数も増え、複製時間が伸びてしまいます。システムによっては、マスターへの書き込みはマルチスレッドで並列処理できる一方、スレーブへの複製は単一スレッドで連続的に処理しなければならない場合があります。レプリケーションでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ: レプリケーションスケーラビリティ、 可用性、 スタビリティ パターンマルチマスター レプリケーションFederation      Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million usersフェデレーション (もしくは機能分割化とも言う) はデータベースを機能ごとに分割する。例えば、モノリシックな単一データベースの代わりに、データベースを フォーラム、 ユーザー、 プロダクト のように三つにすることで、データベース一つあたりの書き込み・読み取りのトラフィックが減り、その結果レプリケーションのラグも短くなります。データベースが小さくなることで、メモリーに収まるデータが増えます。キャッシュの局所性が高まるため、キャッシュヒット率も上がります。単一の中央マスターで書き込みを直列化したりしないため、並列で書き込みを処理することができ、スループットの向上が期待できます。欠点: federation大規模な処理やテーブルを要するスキーマの場合、フェデレーションは効果的とは言えないでしょう。どのデータベースに読み書きをするのかを指定するアプリケーションロジックを更新しなければなりません。server linkで二つのデータベースからのデータを連結するのはより複雑になるでしょう。フェデレーションでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ: federationScaling up to your first 10 million usersシャーディング      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsシャーディングでは異なるデータベースにそれぞれがデータのサブセット断片のみを持つようにデータを分割します。ユーザーデータベースを例にとると、ユーザー数が増えるにつれてクラスターにはより多くの断片が加えられることになります。federationの利点に似ていて、シャーディングでは読み書きのトラフィックを減らし、レプリケーションを減らし、キャッシュヒットを増やすことができます。インデックスサイズも減らすことができます。一般的にはインデックスサイズを減らすと、パフォーマンスが向上しクエリ速度が速くなります。なにがしかのデータを複製する機能がなければデータロスにつながりますが、もし、一つのシャードが落ちても、他のシャードが動いていることになります。フェデレーションと同じく、単一の中央マスターが書き込みの処理をしなくても、並列で書き込みを処理することができ、スループットの向上が期待できます。ユーザーテーブルをシャードする一般的な方法は、ユーザーのラストネームイニシャルでシャードするか、ユーザーの地理的配置でシャードするなどです。欠点: シャーディングシャードに対応するようにアプリケーションロジックを変更しなければなりません。結果としてSQLクエリが複雑になります。シャードではデータ配分がいびつになってしまう可能性があります。例えば、標準ユーザーの集合を持つシャードがある場合、そのシャードが他のシャードよりも重い負荷を負うことになります。リバランシングをすると複雑性がより増します。consistent hashing に基づいたシャーディングでは、通信データを削減することもできます。複数のシャードからのデータを連結するのはより複雑です。シャーディングでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ: シャーディングシャードの登場シャードデータベースアーキテクチャConsistent hashing非正規化非正規化では、書き込みのパフォーマンスをいくらか犠牲にして読み込みのパフォーマンスを向上させようとします。計算的に重いテーブルの結合などをせずに、複数のテーブルに冗長なデータのコピーが書き込まれるのを許容します。いくつかのRDBMS例えば、PostgreSQL やOracleはこの冗長な情報を取り扱い、一貫性を保つためのmaterialized views という機能をサポートしています。フェデレーション や シャーディングなどのテクニックによってそれぞれのデータセンターに分配されたデータを合一させることはとても複雑な作業です。非正規化によってそのような複雑な処理をしなくて済むようになります。多くのシステムで、100対1あるいは1000対1くらいになるくらい読み取りの方が、書き込みのトラフィックよりも多いことでしょう。読み込みを行うために、複雑なデータベースのジョイン処理が含まれるものは計算的に高価につきますし、ディスクの処理時間で膨大な時間を費消してしまうことになります。欠点: 非正規化データが複製される。冗長なデータの複製が同期されるように制約が存在し、そのことでデータベース全体の設計が複雑化する。非正規化されたデータベースは過大な書き込みを処理しなければならない場合、正規化されているそれよりもパフォーマンスにおいて劣る可能性がある。その他の参考資料、ページ: 非正規化DenormalizationSQLチューニングSQLチューニングは広範な知識を必要とする分野で多くの 本 が書かれています。ボトルネックを明らかにし、シミュレートする上で、 ベンチマーク を定め、 プロファイル することはとても重要です。ベンチマーク - abなどのツールを用いて、高負荷の状況をシミュレーションしてみましょう。プロファイル - slow query log などのツールを用いて、パフォーマンス状況の確認をしましょう。ベンチマークとプロファイルをとることで以下のような効率化の選択肢をとることになるでしょう。スキーマを絞るMySQLはアクセス速度向上のため、ディスク上の連続したブロックへデータを格納しています。長さの決まったフィールドに対しては VARCHAR よりも CHAR を使うようにしましょう。CHAR の方が効率的に速くランダムにデータにアクセスできます。 一方、 VARCHAR では次のデータに移る前にデータの末尾を検知しなければならないために速度が犠牲になります。ブログの投稿など、大きなテキストには TEXT を使いましょう。 TEXT ではブーリアン型の検索も可能です。 TEXT フィールドには、テキストブロックが配置されている、ディスク上の場所へのポインターが保存されます。2の32乗や40億以下を超えない程度の大きな数には INT を使いましょう。通貨に関しては小数点表示上のエラーを避けるために DECIMAL を使いましょう。大きな BLOBS を保存するのは避けましょう。どこからそのオブジェクトを取ってくることができるかの情報を保存しましょう。VARCHAR(255) は8ビットで数えられる最大の文字数です。一部のDBMSでは、1バイトの利用効率を最大化するためにこの文字数がよく使われます。検索性能向上のため 、可能であれば NOT NULL 制約を設定しましょう。インデックスを効果的に用いるクエリ(SELECT、 GROUP BY、 ORDER BY、 JOIN) の対象となる列にインデックスを使うことで速度を向上できるかもしれません。インデックスは通常、平衡探索木であるB木の形で表されます。B木によりデータは常にソートされた状態になります。また検索、順次アクセス、挿入、削除を対数時間で行えます。インデックスを配置することはデータをメモリーに残すことにつながりより容量を必要とします。インデックスの更新も必要になるため書き込みも遅くなります。大量のデータをロードする際には、インデックスを切ってからデータをロードして再びインデックスをビルドした方が速いことがあります。高負荷なジョインを避けるパフォーマンス上必要なところには非正規化を適用するテーブルのパーティションテーブルを分割し、ホットスポットを独立したテーブルに分離してメモリーに乗せられるようにする。クエリキャッシュを調整する場合によってはクエリキャッシュ

　SQLもしくはNoSQL最初の1000万ユーザーにスケールアップするためにSQLとNoSQLの違いキャッシュ      Source: Scalable system design patternsキャッシュはページの読み込み時間を削減し、サーバーやデータベースへの負荷を低減することができます。このモデルでは、実際の処理を保存するために、ディスパッチャーがまず以前にリクエストが送信されたかどうかを確認し、直前の結果を受け取ります。データベースはそのパーティションに渡って統合された読み取り書き込みの分配を要求しますが、人気アイテムはその分配を歪めてシステム全体のボトルネックになってしまうことがあります。データベースの前にキャッシュを差し込むことでこのように、均一でない負荷やトラフィックの急激な増加を吸収することができます。クライアントキャッシングキャッシュはOSやブラウザーなどのクライアントサイド、サーバーサイド もしくは独立のキャッシュレイヤーに設置することができます。CDNキャッシングCDN もキャッシュの一つとして考えることができます。Webサーバーキャッシングリバースプロキシ や Varnish などのキャッシュは静的そして動的なコンテンツを直接配信することができます。 webサーバーもリクエストをキャッシュしてアプリケーションサーバーに接続することなしにレスポンスを返すことができます。データベースキャッシングデータベースは普通、一般的な使用状況に適するようなキャッシングの設定を初期状態で持っています。この設定を特定の仕様に合わせて調整することでパフォーマンスを向上させることができます。アプリケーションキャッシングメムキャッシュなどのIn-memoryキャッシュやRedisはアプリケーションとデータストレージの間のキーバリューストアです。データはRAMで保持されるため、データがディスクで保存される一般的なデータベースよりもだいぶ速いです。RAM容量はディスクよりも限られているので、least recently used (LRU)などのcache invalidation アルゴリズムが 'コールド' なエントリを弾き、'ホット' なデータをRAMに保存します。Redisはさらに以下のような機能を備えています:パージステンス設定ソート済みセット、リストなどの組み込みデータ構造キャッシュには様々なレベルのものがありますが、いずれも大きく二つのカテゴリーのいずれかに分類することができます: データベースクエリ と オブジェクト です:行レベルクエリレベルFully-formed serializable objectsFully-rendered HTML一般的に、ファイルベースキャッシングはクローンを作り出してオートスケーリングを難しくしてしまうので避けるべきです。データベースクエリレベルでのキャッシングデータベースをクエリする際には必ずクエリをキーとしてハッシュして結果をキャッシュに保存しましょう。この手法はキャッシュ期限切れ問題に悩むことになります:複雑なクエリによりキャッシュされた結果を削除することが困難テーブルセルなどのデータ断片が変化した時に、その変化したセルを含むかもしれない全てのキャッシュされたクエリを削除する必要がある。オブジェクトレベルでのキャッシングデータをアプリケーションコードでそうするように、オブジェクトとして捉えてみましょう。アプリケーションに、データベースからのデータセットをクラスインスタンスやデータ構造として組み立てさせます。:そのデータが変更されたら、オブジェクトをキャッシュから削除すること非同期処理を許容します: ワーカーがキャッシュされたオブジェクトの中で最新のものを集めてきます何をキャッシュするか:ユーザーのセッション完全にレンダーされたウェブページアクテビティストリームユーザーグラフデータいつキャッシュを更新するかキャッシュに保存できる容量は限られているため、自分のケースではどのキャッシュ手法が一番いいかは検討する必要があります。キャッシュアサイド      Source: From cache to in-memory data gridアプリケーションはストレージへの読み書きの処理をします。キャッシュはストレージとは直接やりとりをしません。アプリケーションは以下のことをします:キャッシュの中のエントリを参照しますが、結果としてキャッシュミスになりますデータベースからエントリを取得しますエントリをキャッシュに追加しますエントリを返しますdef get_user(self, user_id):    user = cache.get(\""user.{0}\"", user_id)    if user is None:        user = db.query(\""SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}\"", user_id)        if user is not None:            key = \""user.{0}\"".format(user_id)            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))    return userMemcached は通常このように使われる。その後のキャッシュデータ読み込みは速いです。キャッシュアサイドはレージーローディングであるとも言われます。リクエストされたデータのみがキャッシュされ、リクエストされていないデータでキャッシュが溢れるのを防止します。欠点: キャッシュアサイド各キャッシュミスは三つのトリップを呼び出すことになり、体感できるほどの遅延が起きてしまいます。データベースのデータが更新されるとキャッシュデータは古いものになってしまいます。time-to-live (TTL)を設定することでキャッシュエントリの更新を強制的に行う、もしくはライトスルーを採用することでこの問題は緩和できます。ノードが落ちると、新規の空のノードで代替されることでレイテンシーが増加することになります。ライトスルー      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsアプリケーションはキャッシュをメインのデータストアとして使い、そこにデータの読み書きを行います。一方、キャッシュはデータベースへの読み書きを担当します。アプリケーションはキャッシュにあるエントリを追加・更新しますキャッシュは同期的にデータストアに書き込みを行いますエントリを返しますアプリケーションコード:set_user(12345, {\""foo\"":\""bar\""})キャッシュコード:def set_user(user_id, values):    user = db.query(\""UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}\"", user_id, values)    cache.set(user_id, user)ライトスルーは書き込み処理のせいで全体としては遅いオペレーションですが、書き込まれたばかりのデータに関する読み込みは速いです。ユーザー側は一般的にデータ更新時の方が読み込み時よりもレイテンシーに許容的です。キャッシュ内のデータは最新版で保たれます。欠点: ライトスルーノードが落ちたこと、もしくはスケーリングによって新しいノードが作成された時に、新しいノードはデータベース内のエントリーが更新されるまではエントリーをキャッシュしません。キャッシュアサイドとライトスルーを併用することでこの問題を緩和できます。書き込まれたデータの大部分は一度も読み込まれることはありません。このデータはTTLによって圧縮することができます。ライトビハインド (ライトバック)      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsライトビハインドではアプリケーションは以下のことをします:キャッシュのエントリーを追加・更新しますデータストアへの書き込みを非同期的に行うことで、書き込みパフォーマンスを向上させます。欠点: ライトビハインドキャッシュがデータストア内のコンテンツにヒットする前にキャッシュが落ちるとデータ欠損が起きる可能性があります。キャッシュアサイドやライトスルーよりも実装が複雑になります。リフレッシュアヘッド      Source: From cache to in-memory data grid期限切れよりも前に、直近でアクセスされた全てのキャッシュエントリを自動的に更新するように設定することができます。もしどのアイテムが将来必要になるのかを正確に予測することができるのならば、リードスルーよりもレイテンシーを削減することができます。欠点: リフレッシュアヘッドどのアイテムが必要になるかの予測が正確でない場合にはリフレッシュアヘッドがない方がレイテンシーは良いという結果になってしまいます。欠点: キャッシュcache invalidationなどを用いて、データベースなどの真のデータとキャッシュの間の一貫性を保つ必要があります。Redisやmemcachedを追加することでアプリケーション構成を変更する必要があります。Cache invalidationも難しいですがそれに加えて、いつキャッシュを更新するかという複雑な問題にも悩まされることになります。その他の参考資料、ページFrom cache to in-memory data gridスケーラブルなシステムデザインパターンスケールできるシステムを設計するためのイントロダクションスケーラビリティ、可用性、安定性、パターンスケーラビリティAWS ElastiCacheのストラテジーWikipedia非同期処理      Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale非同期のワークフローはもし、連続的に行われるとリクエスト時間を圧迫してしまうような重い処理を別で処理する手法です。また、定期的にデータを集合させるなどの時間がかかるような処理を前もって処理しておくことにも役立ちます。メッセージキューメッセージキューはメッセージを受け取り、保存し、配信します。もし、処理がインラインで行うには遅すぎる場合、以下のようなワークフローでメッセージキューを用いるといいでしょう:アプリケーションはジョブをキューに配信し、ユーザーにジョブステータスを伝えます。ワーカーがジョブキューから受け取って、処理を行い、終了したらそのシグナルを返します。ユーザーの処理が止まることはなく、ジョブはバックグラウンドで処理されます。この間に、クライアントはオプションとして、タスクが完了したかのように見せるために小規模の処理を行います。例えば、ツイートを投稿するときに、ツイートはすぐにあなたのタイムラインに反映されたように見えますが、そのツイートが実際に全てのフォロワーに配信されるまでにはもう少し時間がかかっているでしょう。Redis はシンプルなメッセージ仲介としてはいいですが、メッセージが失われてしまう可能性があります。RabbitMQ はよく使われていますが、'AMQP'プロトコルに対応して、自前のノードを立てる必要があります。Amazon SQS という選択肢もありますが、レイテンシーが高く、メッセージが重複して配信されてしまう可能性があります。タスクキュータスクキューはタスクとその関連するデータを受け取り、処理した上でその結果を返します。スケジュール管理をできるほか、バックグラウンドでとても重いジョブをこなすこともできます。Celery はスケジューリングとpythonのサポートがあります。バックプレッシャーもし、キューが拡大しすぎると、メモリーよりもキューの方が大きくなりキャッシュミスが起こり、ディスク読み出しにつながり、パフォーマンスが低下することにつながります。バックプレッシャーはキューサイズを制限することで回避することができ、高いスループットを確保しキューにすでにあるジョブについてのレスポンス時間を短縮できます。キューがいっぱいになると、クライアントはサーバービジーもしくはHTTP 503をレスポンスとして受け取りまた後で時間をおいてアクセスするようにメッセージを受け取ります。クライアントはexponential backoffなどによって後ほど再度時間を置いてリクエストすることができます。欠点: 非同期処理キューを用いることで遅延が起こり、複雑さも増すため、あまり重くない計算処理やリアルタイムワークフローにおいては同期処理の方がいいでしょう。その他の参考資料、ページIt's

はクライアントとサーバー間でのデータをエンコードして転送するための手法です。リクエスト・レスポンスに関わるプロトコルです。クライアントがリクエストをサーバーに投げ、サーバーがリクエストに関係するコンテンツと完了ステータス情報をレスポンスとして返します。HTTPは自己完結するので、間にロードバランサー、キャッシュ、エンクリプション、圧縮などのどんな中間ルーターが入っても動くようにできています。基本的なHTTPリクエストはHTTP動詞(メソッド)とリソース(エンドポイント)で成り立っています。以下がよくあるHTTP動詞です。:動詞詳細冪等性*セーフキャッシュできるかGETリソースを読み取るYesYesYesPOSTリソースを作成するもしくはデータを処理するトリガーNoNoYes

networkの上で成り立つ接続プロトコルです。接続はhandshakeによって開始、解除されます。全ての送信されたパケットは欠損なしで送信先に送信された順番で到達するように以下の方法で保証されています:シーケンス番号とchecksum fieldsが全てのパケットに用意されているAcknowledgementパケットと自動再送信もし送信者が正しいレスポンスを受け取らなかったとき、パケットを再送信します。複数のタイムアウトがあったとき、接続は解除されます。TCP はフロー制御 と 輻輳制御も実装しています。これらの機能によって速度は低下し、一般的にUDPよりも非効率な転送手段になっています。ハイスループットを実現するために、ウェブサーバーはかなり大きな数のTCP接続を開いておくことがあり、そのことでメモリー使用が圧迫されます。ウェブサーバスレッドと例えばmemcached サーバーの間で多数のコネクションを保っておくことは高くつくかもしれません。可能なところではUDPに切り替えるだけでなくコネクションプーリングなども役立つかもしれません。TCPは高い依存性を要し、時間制約が厳しくないものに適しているでしょう。ウェブサーバー、データベース情報、SMTP、FTPやSSHなどの例に適用されます。以下の時にUDPよりもTCPを使うといいでしょう:全てのデータが欠損することなしに届いてほしいネットワークスループットの最適な自動推測をしてオペレーションしたいユーザデータグラムプロトコル (UDP)      Source: How to make a multiplayer gameUDPはコネクションレスです。データグラム（パケットのようなもの）はデータグラムレベルでの保証しかされません。データグラムは順不同で受け取り先に到着したりそもそも着かなかったりします。UDPは輻輳制御をサポートしません。TCPにおいてはサポートされているこれらの保証がないため、UDPは一般的に、TCPよりも効率的です。UDPはサブネット上のすべての機器にデータグラムを送信することができます。これはDHCP において役に立ちます。というのも、クライアントはまだIPアドレスを取得していないので、IPアドレスを必要とするTCPによるストリームができないからです。UDPは信頼性の面では劣りますが、VoIP、ビデオチャット、ストリーミングや同時通信マルチプレイヤーゲームなどのリアルタイム性が重視される時にはとても効果的です。TCPよりもUDPを使うのは:レイテンシーを最低限に抑えたい時データ欠損よりも、データ遅延を重視するときエラー修正を自前で実装したいときその他の参考資料、ページ:

interviewRPCではクライアントがリモートサーバーなどの異なるアドレス空間でプロシージャーが処理されるようにします。プロシージャーはローカルでのコールのように、クライアントからサーバーにどのように通信するかという詳細を省いた状態でコードが書かれます。リモートのコールは普通、ローカルのコールよりも遅く、信頼性に欠けるため、RPCコールをローカルコールと区別させておくことが好ましいでしょう。人気のRPCフレームワークは以下です。Protobuf、 Thrift、AvroRPC は リクエストレスポンスプロトコル:クライアントプログラム - クライアントスタブプロシージャーを呼び出します。パラメータはローカルでのプロシージャーコールのようにスタックへとプッシュされていきます。クライアントスタブプロシージャー - プロシージャIDとアーギュメントをパックしてリクエストメッセージにします。クライアント通信モジュール - OSがクライアントからサーバーへとメッセージを送ります。サーバー通信モジュール - OSが受け取ったパケットをサーバースタブプロシージャーに受け渡します。サーバースタブプロシージャー -  結果を展開し、プロシージャーIDにマッチするサーバープロシージャーを呼び出し、結果を返します。サーバーレスポンスは上記のステップを逆順で繰り返します。Sample RPC calls:GET /someoperation?data=anIdPOST /anotheroperation{  \""data\"":\""anId\"";  \""anotherdata\"": \""another value\""}RPCは振る舞いを公開することに焦点を当てています。RPCは内部通信パフォーマンスを理由として使われることが多いです。というのも、使用する状況に合わせてネイティブコールを自作することができるからです。ネイティブライブラリー (aka SDK) を呼ぶのは以下の時:ターゲットのプラットフォームを知っている時ロジックがどのようにアクセスされるのかを管理したいときライブラリー外でエラーがどのようにコントロールされるかを管理したい時パフォーマンスとエンドユーザーエクスペリエンスが最優先の時REST プロトコルに従うHTTP APIはパブリックAPIにおいてよく用いられます。欠点: RPCRPCクライアントとはサービス実装により厳密に左右されることになります。新しいオペレーション、使用例があるたびに新しくAPIが定義されなければなりません。RPCをデバッグするのは難しい可能性があります。既存のテクノロジーをそのまま使ってサービスを構築することはできないかもしれません。例えば、SquidなどのサーバーにRPCコールが正しくキャッシュ されるように追加で骨を折る必要があるかもしれません。Representational state transfer (REST)RESTは、クライアントがサーバーによってマネージされるリソースに対して処理を行うクライアント・サーバーモデルを支持するアーキテキチャスタイルです。サーバーは操作できるもしくは新しいリソースレプレゼンテーションを受け取ることができるようなリソースやアクションのレプレゼンテーションを提供します。すべての通信はステートレスでキャッシュ可能でなければなりません。RESTful なインターフェースには次の四つの特徴があります:特徴的なリソース (URI in HTTP) - どのオペレーションであっても同じURIを使う。HTTP動詞によって変わる (Verbs in HTTP) - 動詞、ヘッダー、ボディを使う自己説明的なエラーメッセージ (status response in HTTP) - ステータスコードを使い、新しく作ったりしないこと。HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - 自分のwebサービスがブラウザで完全にアクセスできること。サンプル REST コール:GET /someresources/anIdPUT /someresources/anId{\""anotherdata\"": \""another value\""}RESTはデータを公開することに焦点を当てています。クライアントとサーバーのカップリングを最小限にするもので、パブリックAPIなどによく用いられます。RESTはURI、 representation through headers、そして、GET、POST、PUT、 DELETE、PATCHなどのHTTP動詞等のよりジェネリックで統一されたメソッドを用います。ステートレスであるのでRESTは水平スケーリングやパーティショニングに最適です。欠点: RESTRESTはデータ公開に焦点を当てているので、リソースが自然に整理されていなかったり、シンプルなヒエラルキーで表せられない時にはよい選択肢とは言えないかもしれません。例えば、とあるイベントのセットにマッチするすべての更新情報を返すと言った処理は簡単にはパスで表現することができません。RESTでは、URIパス、クエリパラメータ、そして場合によってはリクエストボディなどによって実装されることが多いでしょう。RESTは少数の動詞に依存しています(GET、POST、PUT、DELETE、そして PATCH) が時には使いたい事例に合わないことがあります。例えば、期限の切れたドキュメントをアーカイブに移したい場合などはこれらの動詞の中には綺麗にはフィットしません。ネストされたヒエラルキーの中にあるリソースをとってくるのはシングルビューを描画するのにクライアントとサーバー間で数回やりとりしなければなりません。例として、ブログエントリーのコンテンツとそれに対するコメントを表示する場合などです。様々なネットワーク環境で動作する可能性が考えられるモバイルアプリケーションにおいてはこのような複数のやり取りは好ましくありません。時が経つにつれて、APIレスポンスにより多くのフィールドが与えられて、古いクライアントはすでにいらないものも含めてすべてのデータフィールドを受け取ることになります。そのことで、ペイロードが大きくなりすぎて、レイテンシーも拡大することになります。RPCとREST比較OperationRPCRESTサインアップPOST

48,huggingface/transformers,https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/README.md,Python,"                                                                                                                    English |        简体中文 |        繁體中文 |        한국어 |        Español |        日本語 |        हिन्दी        State-of-the-art Machine Learning for JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow    🤗 Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio.These models can be applied on:📝 Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, in over 100 languages.🖼️ Images, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.🗣️ Audio, for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.Transformer models can also perform tasks on several modalities combined, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.🤗 Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and then share them with the community on our model hub. At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.🤗 Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow — with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.Online demosYou can test most of our models directly on their pages from the model hub. We also offer private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API for public and private models.Here are a few examples:In Natural Language Processing:Masked word completion with BERTName Entity Recognition with ElectraText generation with GPT-2Natural Language Inference with RoBERTaSummarization with BARTQuestion answering with DistilBERTTranslation with T5In Computer Vision:Image classification with ViTObject Detection with DETRSemantic Segmentation with SegFormerPanoptic Segmentation with MaskFormerDepth Estimation with DPTVideo Classification with VideoMAEUniversal Segmentation with OneFormerIn Audio:Automatic Speech Recognition with Wav2Vec2Keyword Spotting with Wav2Vec2Audio Classification with Audio Spectrogram TransformerIn Multimodal tasks:Table Question Answering with TAPASVisual Question Answering with ViLTZero-shot Image Classification with CLIPDocument Question Answering with LayoutLMZero-shot Video Classification with X-CLIP100 projects using TransformersTransformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models: it's a community of projects built around it and theHugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyoneelse to build their dream projects.In order to celebrate the 100,000 stars of transformers, we have decided to put the spotlight on thecommunity, and we have created the awesome-transformers page which lists 100incredible projects built in the vicinity of transformers.If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!If you are looking for custom support from the Hugging Face team    Quick tourTo immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:>>> from transformers import pipeline# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')>>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.')[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996980428695679}]The second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here the answer is \""positive\"" with a confidence of 99.97%.Many tasks have a pre-trained pipeline ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image:>>> import requests>>> from PIL import Image>>> from transformers import pipeline# Download an image with cute cats>>> url = \""https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\"">>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw>>> image = Image.open(image_data)# Allocate a pipeline for object detection>>> object_detector = pipeline('object-detection')>>> object_detector(image)[{'score': 0.9982201457023621,  'label': 'remote',  'box': {'xmin': 40, 'ymin': 70, 'xmax': 175, 'ymax': 117}}, {'score': 0.9960021376609802,  'label': 'remote',  'box': {'xmin': 333, 'ymin': 72, 'xmax': 368, 'ymax': 187}}, {'score': 0.9954745173454285,  'label': 'couch',  'box': {'xmin': 0, 'ymin': 1, 'xmax': 639, 'ymax': 473}}, {'score': 0.9988006353378296,  'label': 'cat',  'box': {'xmin': 13, 'ymin': 52, 'xmax': 314, 'ymax': 470}}, {'score': 0.9986783862113953,  'label': 'cat',  'box': {'xmin': 345, 'ymin': 23, 'xmax': 640, 'ymax': 368}}]Here we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score. Here is the original image on the left, with the predictions displayed on the right:        You can learn more about the tasks supported by the pipeline API in this tutorial.In addition to pipeline, to download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, all it takes is three lines of code. Here is the PyTorch version:>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> inputs = tokenizer(\""Hello world!\"", return_tensors=\""pt\"")>>> outputs = model(**inputs)And here is the equivalent code for TensorFlow:>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> inputs = tokenizer(\""Hello world!\"", return_tensors=\""tf\"")>>> outputs = model(**inputs)The tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects, and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.The model itself is a regular Pytorch nn.Module or a TensorFlow tf.keras.Model (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. This tutorial explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our Trainer API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset.Why should I use transformers?Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks.Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.A unified API for using all our pretrained models.Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.Dozens of architectures with over 60,000 pretrained models across all modalities.Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will.Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation and production.Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.Why shouldn't I use transformers?This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, Accelerate).While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our examples folder are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.InstallationWith pipThis repository is tested on Python 3.8+, Flax 0.4.1+, PyTorch 1.10+ and TensorFlow 2.6+.You should install 🤗 Transformers in a virtual environment. If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the user guide.First, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.Then, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow.Please refer to TensorFlow installation page, PyTorch installation page and/or Flax and Jax installation pages regarding the specific installation command for your platform.When one of those backends has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:pip install transformersIf you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you must install the library from source.With condaSince Transformers version v4.0.0, we now have a conda channel: huggingface.🤗 Transformers can be installed using conda as follows:conda install -c huggingface transformersFollow the installation pages of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow to see how to install them with conda.NOTE:  On Windows, you may be prompted to activate Developer Mode in order to benefit from caching.

いえ、ここにあるすべてをやる必要はありません。面接で何を聞かれるかは以下の条件によって変わってきます:どれだけの技術経験があるかあなたの技術背景が何であるかどのポジションのために面接を受けているかどの企業の面接を受けているか運より経験のある候補者は一般的にシステム設計についてより深い知識を有していることを要求されるでしょう。システムアーキテクトやチームリーダーは各メンバーの持つような知識よりは深い見識を持っているべきでしょう。一流テック企業では複数回の設計面接を課されることが多いです。まずは広く始めて、そこからいくつかの分野に絞って深めていくのがいいでしょう。様々なシステム設計のトピックについて少しずつ知っておくことはいいことです。以下の学習ガイドを自分の学習に当てられる時間、技術経験、どの職位、どの会社に応募しているかなどを加味して自分用に調整して使うといいでしょう。短期間

自分で会話を組み立てることを求められます。以下のステップに従って議論を組み立てることができるでしょう。この過程を確かなものにするために、次のセクションシステム設計課題例とその解答 を以下の指針に従って読み込むといいでしょう。ステップ 1: そのシステム使用例の概要、制約、推計値等を聞き出し、まとめるシステム仕様の要求事項を聞き出し、問題箇所を特定しましょう。使用例と制約を明確にするための質問を投げかけましょう。要求する推計値についても議論しておきましょう。誰がそのサービスを使うのか？どのように使うのか？何人のユーザーがいるのか？システムはどのような機能を果たすのか？システムへの入力と出力は？どれだけの容量のデータを捌く必要があるのか？一秒間に何リクエストの送信が想定されるか？読み書き比率の推定値はいくら程度か？ステップ 2: より高レベルのシステム設計を組み立てる重要なコンポーネントを全て考慮した高レベルのシステム設計概要を組み立てる。主要なコンポーネントと接続をスケッチして書き出す考えの裏付けをするステップ 3: 核となるコンポーネントを設計するそれぞれの主要なコンポーネントについての詳細を学ぶ。例えば、url短縮サービスの設計を問われた際には次のようにするといいでしょう:元のURLのハッシュ化したものを作り、それを保存するMD5 と Base62ハッシュ衝突SQL もしくは NoSQLデータベーススキーマハッシュ化されたURLを元のURLに再翻訳するデータベース参照API & オブジェクト指向の設計ステップ 4: システム設計のスケール与えられた制約条件からボトルネックとなりそうなところを割り出し、明確化する。  例えば、スケーラビリティの問題解決のために以下の要素を考慮する必要があるだろうか？ロードバランサー水平スケーリングキャッシングデータベースシャーディング取りうる解決策とそのトレードオフについて議論をしよう。全てのことはトレードオフの関係にある。ボトルネックについてはスケーラブルなシステム設計の原理を読むといいでしょう。ちょっとした暗算問題ちょっとした推計値を手計算ですることを求められることもあるかもしれません。補遺の以下の項目が役に立つでしょう:チラ裏計算でシステム設計する2の乗数表全てのプログラマーが知っておくべきレイテンシの参考値文献とその他の参考資料以下のリンク先ページを見てどのような質問を投げかけられるか概要を頭に入れておきましょう:システム設計面接で成功するには？システム設計面接アーキテクチャ、システム設計面接への導入システム設計課題例とその解答頻出のシステム設計面接課題と参考解答、コード及びダイアグラム解答は

一貫性全てはトレードオフの関係にあるというのを肝に命じておきましょう。それから、より深い内容、DNSやCDNそしてロードバランサーなどについて学習を進めていきましょう。パフォーマンス vs スケーラビリティリソースが追加されるのにつれて パフォーマンス が向上する場合そのサービスは スケーラブル であると言えるでしょう。一般的に、パフォーマンスを向上させるというのはすなわち計算処理を増やすことを意味しますが、データセットが増えた時などより大きな処理を捌けるようになることでもあります。1パフォーマンスvsスケーラビリティをとらえる他の考え方:パフォーマンス での問題を抱えている時、あなたのシステムは一人のユーザーにとって遅いと言えるでしょう。スケーラビリティ での問題を抱えているとき、一人のユーザーにとっては速いですが、多くのリクエストがある時には遅くなってしまうでしょう。その他の参考資料、ページスケーラビリティについてスケーラビリティ、可用性、安定性、パターンレイテンシー vs スループットレイテンシー とはなにがしかの動作を行う、もしくは結果を算出するのに要する時間スループット とはそのような動作や結果算出が単位時間に行われる回数一般的に、 最大限のスループット を 許容範囲内のレイテンシー で実現することを目指すのが普通だ。その他の参考資料、ページレイテンシー vs スループットを理解する可用性 vs 一貫性CAP 理論      Source: CAP theorem revisited分散型コンピュータシステムにおいては下の三つのうち二つまでしか同時に保証することはできない。:一貫性 - 全ての読み込みは最新の書き込みもしくはエラーを受け取る可用性 - 受け取る情報が最新のものだという保証はないが、全てのリクエストはレスポンスを必ず受け取る分断耐性 - ネットワーク問題によって順不同の分断が起きてもシステムが動作を続けるネットワークは信頼できないので、分断耐性は必ず保証しなければなりません。つまりソフトウェアシステムとしてのトレードオフは、一貫性を取るか、可用性を取るかを考えなければなりません。CP - 一貫性と分断耐性(consistency and partition tolerance)分断されたノードからのレスポンスを待ち続けているとタイムアウトエラーに陥る可能性があります。CPはあなたのサービスがアトミックな読み書き（不可分操作）を必要とする際にはいい選択肢でしょう。AP - 可用性と分断耐性(availability and partition tolerance)レスポンスはノード上にあるデータで最新のものを返します。つまり、最新版のデータが返されるとは限りません。分断が解消された後も、書き込みが反映されるのには時間がかかります。結果整合性　を求めるサービスの際にはAPを採用するのがいいでしょう。もしくは、外部エラーに関わらずシステムが稼働する必要がある際にも同様です。その他の参考資料、ページCAP 理論を振り返る平易な英語でのCAP 理論のイントロCAP FAQ一貫性パターン同じデータの複製が複数ある状態では、クライアントが一貫したデータ表示を受け取るために、どのようにそれらを同期すればいいのかという課題があります。 CAP 理論 における一貫性の定義を思い出してみましょう。全ての読み取りは最新の書き込みデータもしくはエラーを受け取るはずです。弱い一貫性書き込み後の読み取りでは、その最新の書き込みを読めたり読めなかったりする。ベストエフォート型のアプローチに基づく。このアプローチはmemcachedなどのシステムに見られます。弱い一貫性はリアルタイム性が必要なユースケース、例えばVoIP、ビデオチャット、リアルタイムマルチプレイヤーゲームなどと相性がいいでしょう。例えば、電話に出ているときに数秒間音声が受け取れなくなったとしたら、その後に接続が回復してもその接続が切断されていた間に話されていたことは聞き取れないというような感じです。結果整合性書き込みの後、読み取りは最終的にはその結果を読み取ることができる(ミリ秒ほど遅れてというのが一般的です)。データは非同期的に複製されます。このアプローチはDNSやメールシステムなどに採用されています。結果整合性は多くのリクエストを捌くサービスと相性がいいでしょう。強い一貫性書き込みの後、読み取りはそれを必ず読むことができます。データは同期的に複製されます。このアプローチはファイルシステムやRDBMSなどで採用されています。トランザクションを扱うサービスでは強い一貫性が必要でしょう。その他の参考資料、ページデータセンター間でのトランザクション可用性パターン高い可用性を担保するには主に次の二つのパターンがあります: フェイルオーバー と レプリケーション です。フェイルオーバーアクティブ・パッシブアクティブ・パッシブフェイルオーバーにおいては、周期信号はアクティブもしくはスタンバイ中のパッシブなサーバーに送られます。周期信号が中断された時には、パッシブだったサーバーがアクティブサーバーのIPアドレスを引き継いでサービスを再開します。起動までのダウンタイムはパッシブサーバーが「ホット」なスタンバイ状態にあるか、「コールド」なスタンバイ状態にあるかで変わります。アクティブなサーバーのみがトラフィックを捌きます。アクティブ・パッシブフェイルオーバーはマスター・スレーブフェイルオーバーと呼ばれることもあります。アクティブ・アクティブアクティブアクティブ構成では両方のサーバーがトラフィックを捌くことで負荷を分散します。これらのサーバーがパブリックなものの場合、DNSは両方のサーバーのパブリックIPを知っている必要があります。もし、プライベートなものな場合、アプリケーションロジックが両方のサーバーの情報について知っている必要があります。アクティブ・アクティブなフェイルオーバーはマスター・マスターフェイルオーバーと呼ばれることもあります。短所: フェイルオーバーフェイルオーバーではより多くのハードウェアを要し、複雑さが増します。最新の書き込みがパッシブサーバーに複製される前にアクティブが落ちると、データ欠損が起きる潜在可能性があります。レプリケーションマスター・スレーブ　と　マスター・マスターこのトピックは データベース セクションにおいてより詳細に解説されています:マスター・スレーブ レプリケーションマスター・マスター レプリケーションドメインネームシステム      Source: DNS security presentationドメインネームシステム (DNS) は www.example.com などのドメインネームをIPアドレスへと翻訳します。DNSは少数のオーソライズされたサーバーが上位に位置する階層的構造です。あなたのルーターもしくはISPは検索をする際にどのDNSサーバーに接続するかという情報を提供します。低い階層のDNSサーバーはその経路マップをキャッシュします。ただ、この情報は伝搬遅延によって陳腐化する可能性があります。DNSの結果はあなたのブラウザもしくはOSに一定期間（time to live (TTL)に設定された期間）キャッシュされます。NS record (name server) - あなたのドメイン・サブドメインでのDNSサーバーを特定します。MX record (mail exchange) - メッセージを受け取るメールサーバーを特定します。A record (address) - IPアドレスに名前をつけます。CNAME (canonical) - 他の名前もしくは　CNAME (example.com を www.example.com) もしくは A recordへと名前を指し示す。CloudFlare や Route 53 などのサービスはマネージドDNSサービスを提供しています。いくつかのDNSサービスでは様々な手法を使ってトラフィックを捌くことができます:加重ラウンドロビントラフィックがメンテナンス中のサーバーに行くのを防ぎます様々なクラスターサイズに応じて調整しますA/B テストレイテンシーベース地理ベース欠点: DNS上記で示されているようなキャッシングによって緩和されているとはいえ、DNSサーバーへの接続には少し遅延が生じる。DNSサーバーは、政府、ISP企業,そして大企業に管理されているが、それらの管理は複雑である。DNSサービスはDDoS attackの例で、IPアドレスなしにユーザーがTwitterなどにアクセスできなくなったように、攻撃を受ける可能性がある。その他の参考資料、ページDNS アーキテクチャWikipediaDNS 記事コンテンツデリバリーネットワーク(Content delivery network)      Source: Why use a CDNコンテンツデリバリーネットワーク(CDN)は世界中に配置されたプロキシサーバーのネットワークがユーザーに一番地理的に近いサーバーからコンテンツを配信するシステムのことです。AmazonのCloudFrontなどは例外的にダイナミックなコンテンツも配信しますが、一般的に、HTML/CSS/JS、写真、そして動画などの静的ファイルがCDNを通じて配信されます。そのサイトのDNSがクライアントにどのサーバーと交信するかという情報を伝えます。CDNを用いてコンテンツを配信することで以下の二つの理由でパフォーマンスが劇的に向上します:ユーザーは近くにあるデータセンターから受信できるバックエンドサーバーはCDNが処理してくれるリクエストに関しては処理する必要がなくなりますプッシュCDNプッシュCDNではサーバーデータに更新があった時には必ず、新しいコンテンツを受け取る方式です。コンテンツを用意し、CDNに直接アップロードし、URLをCDNを指すように指定するところまで、全て自分で責任を負う形です。コンテンツがいつ期限切れになるのか更新されるのかを設定することができます。コンテンツは新規作成時、更新時のみアップロードされることでトラフィックは最小化される一方、ストレージは最大限消費されてしまいます。トラフィックの少ない、もしくは頻繁にはコンテンツが更新されないサイトの場合にはプッシュCDNと相性がいいでしょう。コンテンツは定期的に再びプルされるのではなく、CDNに一度のみ配置されます。プルCDNプルCDNでは一人目のユーザーがリクエストした時に、新しいコンテンツをサービスのサーバーから取得します。コンテンツは自分のサーバーに保存して、CDNを指すURLを書き換えます。結果として、CDNにコンテンツがキャッシュされるまではリクエスト処理が遅くなります。time-to-live (TTL) はコンテンツがどれだけの期間キャッシュされるかを規定します。プルCDNはCDN 上でのストレージスペースを最小化しますが、有効期限が切れたファイルが更新前にプルされてしまうことで冗長なトラフィックに繋がってしまう可能性があります。大規模なトラフィックのあるサイトではプルCDNが相性がいいでしょう。というのも、トラフィックの大部分は最近リクエストされ、CDNに残っているコンテンツにアクセスするものであることが多いからです。欠点: CDNCDNのコストはトラフィック量によって変わります。もちろん、CDNを使わない場合のコストと比較するべきでしょう。TTLが切れる前にコンテンツが更新されると陳腐化する恐れがあります。CDNでは静的コンテンツがCDNを指すようにURLを更新する必要があります。その他の参考資料、ページグローバルに分散されたコンテンツデリバリーネットワークプッシュCDNとプルCDNの違いWikipediaロードバランサー      Source: Scalable system design patternsロードバランサーは入力されるクライアントのリクエストをアプリケーションサーバーやデータベースへと分散させる。どのケースでもロードバランサーはサーバー等計算リソースからのレスポンスを適切なクライアントに返す。ロードバランサーは以下のことに効果的です:リクエストが状態の良くないサーバーに行くのを防ぐリクエストを過剰に送るのを防ぐ特定箇所の欠陥でサービスが落ちることを防ぐロードバランサーは (費用の高い) ハードウェアもしくはHAProxyなどのソフトウェアで実現できる。他の利点としては:SSL termination - 入力されるリクエストを解読する、また、サーバーレスポンスを暗号化することでバックエンドのサーバーがこのコストが高くつきがちな処理を請け負わなくていいように肩代わりします。X.509 certificates をそれぞれのサーバーにインストールする必要をなくしますセッション管理 - クッキーを取り扱うウェブアプリがセッション情報を保持していない時などに、特定のクライアントのリクエストを同じインスタンスへと流します。障害に対応するために、アクティブ・パッシブ もしくは アクティブ・アクティブ モードのどちらにおいても、複数のロードバランサーを配置するのが一般的です。ロードバランサーは以下のような種々のメトリックを用いてトラフィックルーティングを行うことができます:ランダムLeast loadedセッション/クッキーラウンドロビンもしくは加重ラウンドロビンLayer 4Layer 7Layer 4 ロードバランシングLayer 4 ロードバランサーは トランスポートレイヤー を参照してどのようにリクエストを配分するか判断します。一般的に、トランスポートレイヤーとしては、ソース、送信先IPアドレス、ヘッダーに記述されたポート番号が含まれますが、パケットの中身のコンテンツは含みません。 Layer 4 ロードバランサーはネットワークパケットを上流サーバーへ届け、上流サーバーから配信することでネットワークアドレス変換 Network Address Translation (NAT) を実現します。Layer 7 ロードバランシングLayer 7 ロードバランサーは アプリケーションレイヤー を参照してどのようにリクエストを配分するか判断します。ヘッダー、メッセージ、クッキーなどのコンテンツのことです。Layer 7 ロードバランサーはネットワークトラフィックの終端を受け持ち メッセージを読み込み、ロードバランシングの判断をし、選択したサーバーとの接続を繋ぎます。例えば layer 7 ロードバランサーは動画のトラフィックを直接、そのデータをホストしているサーバーにつなぐと同時に、決済処理などのより繊細なトラフィックをセキュリティ強化されたサーバーに流すということもできる。柔軟性とのトレードオフになりますが、 layer 4 ロードバランサーではLayer 7ロードバランサーよりも所要時間、計算リソースを少なく済ませることができます。ただし、昨今の汎用ハードウェアではパフォーマンスは最小限のみしか発揮できないでしょう。水平スケーリングロードバランサーでは水平スケーリングによってパフォーマンスと可用性を向上させることができます。手頃な汎用マシンを追加することによってスケールアウトさせる方が、一つのサーバーをより高価なマシンにスケールアップする（垂直スケーリング）より費用対効果も高くなり、結果的に可用性も高くなります。また、汎用ハードウェアを扱える人材を雇う方が、特化型の商用ハードウェアを扱える人材を雇うよりも簡単でしょう。欠点: 水平スケーリング水平的にスケーリングしていくと、複雑さが増す上に、サーバーのクローニングが必要になる。サーバーはステートレスである必要がある: ユーザーに関連するセッションや、プロフィール写真などのデータを持ってはいけないセッションは一元的なデータベース (SQL、 NoSQL)などのデータストアにストアされるか キャッシュ (Redis、 Memcached)に残す必要があります。キャッシュやデータベースなどの下流サーバーは上流サーバーがスケールアウトするにつれてより多くの同時接続を保たなければなりません。欠点: ロードバランサーロードバランサーはリソースが不足していたり、設定が適切でない場合、システム全体のボトルネックになる可能性があります。単一障害点を除こうとしてロードバランサーを導入した結果、複雑さが増してしまうことになります。ロードバランサーが一つだけだとそこが単一障害点になってしまいます。一方で、ロードバランサーを複数にすると、さらに複雑さが増してしまいます。その他の参考資料、ページNGINX

リバースプロキシサーバーは内部サービスをまとめて外部に統一されたインターフェースを提供するウェブサーバーです。クライアントからのリクエストはそれに対応するサーバーに送られて、その後レスポンスをリバースプロキシがクライアントに返します。他には以下のような利点があります:より堅牢なセキュリティ - バックエンドサーバーの情報を隠したり、IPアドレスをブラックリスト化したり、クライアントごとの接続数を制限したりできます。スケーラビリティや柔軟性が増します - クライアントはリバースプロキシのIPしか見ないので、裏でサーバーをスケールしたり、設定を変えやすくなります。SSL termination - 入力されるリクエストを解読し、サーバーのレスポンスを暗号化することでサーバーがこのコストのかかりうる処理をしなくて済むようになります。X.509 証明書 を各サーバーにインストールする必要がなくなります。圧縮 - サーバーレスポンスを圧縮できますキャッシング - キャッシュされたリクエストに対して、レスポンスを返します静的コンテンツ - 静的コンテンツを直接送信することができます。HTML/CSS/JS写真動画などなどロードバランサー vs リバースプロキシ複数のサーバーがある時にはロードバランサーをデプロイすると役に立つでしょう。 しばしば、ロードバランサーは同じ機能を果たすサーバー群へのトラフィックを捌きます。リバースプロキシでは、上記に述べたような利点を、単一のウェブサーバーやアプリケーションレイヤーに対しても示すことができます。NGINX や HAProxy などの技術はlayer 7 リバースプロキシとロードバランサーの両方をサポートします。欠点: リバースプロキシリバースプロキシを導入するとシステムの複雑性が増します。単一のリバースプロキシは単一障害点になりえます。一方で、複数のリバースプロキシを導入すると(例: フェイルオーバー) 複雑性はより増します。その他の参考資料、ページリバースプロキシ vs ロードバランサーNGINX アーキテクチャHAProxy アーキテクチャ ガイドWikipediaアプリケーション層

では、小さい自律的なサービスが協調して動くように提唱しています。小さいサービスの小さいチームが急成長のためにより積極的な計画を立てられるようにするためです。アプリケーション層は非同期処理もサポートします。マイクロサービス独立してデプロイできる、小規模なモジュール様式であるマイクロサービスもこの議論に関係してくる技術でしょう。それぞれのサービスは独自のプロセスを処理し、明確で軽量なメカニズムで通信して、その目的とする機能を実現します。1例えばPinterestでは以下のようなマイクロサービスに分かれています。ユーザープロフィール、フォロワー、フィード、検索、写真アップロードなどです。サービスディスカバリーConsul、 Etcd、 Zookeeper などのシステムでは、登録されているサービスの名前、アドレス、ポートの情報を監視することで、サービス同士が互いを見つけやすくしています。サービスの完全性の確認には Health checks が便利で、これには HTTP エンドポイントがよく使われます。 Consul と Etcd のいずれも組み込みの key-value store を持っており、設定データや共有データなどのデータを保存しておくことに使われます。欠点: アプリケーション層アーキテクチャ、運用、そしてプロセスを考慮すると、緩く結び付けられたアプリケーション層を追加するには、モノリシックなシステムとは異なるアプローチが必要です。マイクロサービスはデプロイと運用の点から見ると複雑性が増すことになります。その他の参考資料、ページスケールするシステムアーキテクチャを設計するためのイントロシステム設計インタビューを紐解くサービス指向アーキテクチャZookeeperのイントロダクションマイクロサービスを作るために知っておきたいことデータベース

レプリケーション、マスターマスター レプリケーションの 両方 の欠点は欠点: レプリケーション を参照欠点: レプリケーション新しいデータ書き込みを複製する前にマスターが落ちた場合にはそのデータが失われてしまう可能性がある。書き込みは読み取りレプリカにおいてリプレイされる。書き込みが多い場合、複製ノードが書き込みの処理のみで行き詰まって、読み取りの処理を満足に行えない可能性がある。読み取りスレーブノードの数が多ければ多いほど、複製しなければならない数も増え、複製時間が伸びてしまいます。システムによっては、マスターへの書き込みはマルチスレッドで並列処理できる一方、スレーブへの複製は単一スレッドで連続的に処理しなければならない場合があります。レプリケーションでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ: レプリケーションスケーラビリティ、 可用性、 スタビリティ パターンマルチマスター レプリケーションFederation      Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million usersフェデレーション (もしくは機能分割化とも言う) はデータベースを機能ごとに分割する。例えば、モノリシックな単一データベースの代わりに、データベースを フォーラム、 ユーザー、 プロダクト のように三つにすることで、データベース一つあたりの書き込み・読み取りのトラフィックが減り、その結果レプリケーションのラグも短くなります。データベースが小さくなることで、メモリーに収まるデータが増えます。キャッシュの局所性が高まるため、キャッシュヒット率も上がります。単一の中央マスターで書き込みを直列化したりしないため、並列で書き込みを処理することができ、スループットの向上が期待できます。欠点: federation大規模な処理やテーブルを要するスキーマの場合、フェデレーションは効果的とは言えないでしょう。どのデータベースに読み書きをするのかを指定するアプリケーションロジックを更新しなければなりません。server linkで二つのデータベースからのデータを連結するのはより複雑になるでしょう。フェデレーションでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ: federationScaling up to your first 10 million usersシャーディング      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsシャーディングでは異なるデータベースにそれぞれがデータのサブセット断片のみを持つようにデータを分割します。ユーザーデータベースを例にとると、ユーザー数が増えるにつれてクラスターにはより多くの断片が加えられることになります。federationの利点に似ていて、シャーディングでは読み書きのトラフィックを減らし、レプリケーションを減らし、キャッシュヒットを増やすことができます。インデックスサイズも減らすことができます。一般的にはインデックスサイズを減らすと、パフォーマンスが向上しクエリ速度が速くなります。なにがしかのデータを複製する機能がなければデータロスにつながりますが、もし、一つのシャードが落ちても、他のシャードが動いていることになります。フェデレーションと同じく、単一の中央マスターが書き込みの処理をしなくても、並列で書き込みを処理することができ、スループットの向上が期待できます。ユーザーテーブルをシャードする一般的な方法は、ユーザーのラストネームイニシャルでシャードするか、ユーザーの地理的配置でシャードするなどです。欠点: シャーディングシャードに対応するようにアプリケーションロジックを変更しなければなりません。結果としてSQLクエリが複雑になります。シャードではデータ配分がいびつになってしまう可能性があります。例えば、標準ユーザーの集合を持つシャードがある場合、そのシャードが他のシャードよりも重い負荷を負うことになります。リバランシングをすると複雑性がより増します。consistent hashing に基づいたシャーディングでは、通信データを削減することもできます。複数のシャードからのデータを連結するのはより複雑です。シャーディングでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ: シャーディングシャードの登場シャードデータベースアーキテクチャConsistent hashing非正規化非正規化では、書き込みのパフォーマンスをいくらか犠牲にして読み込みのパフォーマンスを向上させようとします。計算的に重いテーブルの結合などをせずに、複数のテーブルに冗長なデータのコピーが書き込まれるのを許容します。いくつかのRDBMS例えば、PostgreSQL やOracleはこの冗長な情報を取り扱い、一貫性を保つためのmaterialized views という機能をサポートしています。フェデレーション や シャーディングなどのテクニックによってそれぞれのデータセンターに分配されたデータを合一させることはとても複雑な作業です。非正規化によってそのような複雑な処理をしなくて済むようになります。多くのシステムで、100対1あるいは1000対1くらいになるくらい読み取りの方が、書き込みのトラフィックよりも多いことでしょう。読み込みを行うために、複雑なデータベースのジョイン処理が含まれるものは計算的に高価につきますし、ディスクの処理時間で膨大な時間を費消してしまうことになります。欠点: 非正規化データが複製される。冗長なデータの複製が同期されるように制約が存在し、そのことでデータベース全体の設計が複雑化する。非正規化されたデータベースは過大な書き込みを処理しなければならない場合、正規化されているそれよりもパフォーマンスにおいて劣る可能性がある。その他の参考資料、ページ: 非正規化DenormalizationSQLチューニングSQLチューニングは広範な知識を必要とする分野で多くの 本 が書かれています。ボトルネックを明らかにし、シミュレートする上で、 ベンチマーク を定め、 プロファイル することはとても重要です。ベンチマーク - abなどのツールを用いて、高負荷の状況をシミュレーションしてみましょう。プロファイル - slow query log などのツールを用いて、パフォーマンス状況の確認をしましょう。ベンチマークとプロファイルをとることで以下のような効率化の選択肢をとることになるでしょう。スキーマを絞るMySQLはアクセス速度向上のため、ディスク上の連続したブロックへデータを格納しています。長さの決まったフィールドに対しては VARCHAR よりも CHAR を使うようにしましょう。CHAR の方が効率的に速くランダムにデータにアクセスできます。 一方、 VARCHAR では次のデータに移る前にデータの末尾を検知しなければならないために速度が犠牲になります。ブログの投稿など、大きなテキストには TEXT を使いましょう。 TEXT ではブーリアン型の検索も可能です。 TEXT フィールドには、テキストブロックが配置されている、ディスク上の場所へのポインターが保存されます。2の32乗や40億以下を超えない程度の大きな数には INT を使いましょう。通貨に関しては小数点表示上のエラーを避けるために DECIMAL を使いましょう。大きな BLOBS を保存するのは避けましょう。どこからそのオブジェクトを取ってくることができるかの情報を保存しましょう。VARCHAR(255) は8ビットで数えられる最大の文字数です。一部のDBMSでは、1バイトの利用効率を最大化するためにこの文字数がよく使われます。検索性能向上のため 、可能であれば NOT NULL 制約を設定しましょう。インデックスを効果的に用いるクエリ(SELECT、 GROUP BY、 ORDER BY、 JOIN) の対象となる列にインデックスを使うことで速度を向上できるかもしれません。インデックスは通常、平衡探索木であるB木の形で表されます。B木によりデータは常にソートされた状態になります。また検索、順次アクセス、挿入、削除を対数時間で行えます。インデックスを配置することはデータをメモリーに残すことにつながりより容量を必要とします。インデックスの更新も必要になるため書き込みも遅くなります。大量のデータをロードする際には、インデックスを切ってからデータをロードして再びインデックスをビルドした方が速いことがあります。高負荷なジョインを避けるパフォーマンス上必要なところには非正規化を適用するテーブルのパーティションテーブルを分割し、ホットスポットを独立したテーブルに分離してメモリーに乗せられるようにする。クエリキャッシュを調整する場合によってはクエリキャッシュ

と対照的に、BASEは一貫性よりも可用性を優先します。Basically available - システムは可用性を保証します。Soft state - システムの状態は入力がなくても時間経過とともに変化する可能性があります。結果整合性 - システム全体は時間経過とともにその間に入力がないという前提のもと、一貫性が達成されます。SQLか？NoSQLか？

もしくは独立のキャッシュレイヤーに設置することができます。CDNキャッシングCDN もキャッシュの一つとして考えることができます。Webサーバーキャッシングリバースプロキシ や Varnish などのキャッシュは静的そして動的なコンテンツを直接配信することができます。 webサーバーもリクエストをキャッシュしてアプリケーションサーバーに接続することなしにレスポンスを返すことができます。データベースキャッシングデータベースは普通、一般的な使用状況に適するようなキャッシングの設定を初期状態で持っています。この設定を特定の仕様に合わせて調整することでパフォーマンスを向上させることができます。アプリケーションキャッシングメムキャッシュなどのIn-memoryキャッシュやRedisはアプリケーションとデータストレージの間のキーバリューストアです。データはRAMで保持されるため、データがディスクで保存される一般的なデータベースよりもだいぶ速いです。RAM容量はディスクよりも限られているので、least recently used (LRU)などのcache invalidation アルゴリズムが 'コールド' なエントリを弾き、'ホット' なデータをRAMに保存します。Redisはさらに以下のような機能を備えています:パージステンス設定ソート済みセット、リストなどの組み込みデータ構造キャッシュには様々なレベルのものがありますが、いずれも大きく二つのカテゴリーのいずれかに分類することができます: データベースクエリ と オブジェクト です:行レベルクエリレベルFully-formed serializable objectsFully-rendered HTML一般的に、ファイルベースキャッシングはクローンを作り出してオートスケーリングを難しくしてしまうので避けるべきです。データベースクエリレベルでのキャッシングデータベースをクエリする際には必ずクエリをキーとしてハッシュして結果をキャッシュに保存しましょう。この手法はキャッシュ期限切れ問題に悩むことになります:複雑なクエリによりキャッシュされた結果を削除することが困難テーブルセルなどのデータ断片が変化した時に、その変化したセルを含むかもしれない全てのキャッシュされたクエリを削除する必要がある。オブジェクトレベルでのキャッシングデータをアプリケーションコードでそうするように、オブジェクトとして捉えてみましょう。アプリケーションに、データベースからのデータセットをクラスインスタンスやデータ構造として組み立てさせます。:そのデータが変更されたら、オブジェクトをキャッシュから削除すること非同期処理を許容します: ワーカーがキャッシュされたオブジェクトの中で最新のものを集めてきます何をキャッシュするか:ユーザーのセッション完全にレンダーされたウェブページアクテビティストリームユーザーグラフデータいつキャッシュを更新するかキャッシュに保存できる容量は限られているため、自分のケースではどのキャッシュ手法が一番いいかは検討する必要があります。キャッシュアサイド      Source: From cache to in-memory data gridアプリケーションはストレージへの読み書きの処理をします。キャッシュはストレージとは直接やりとりをしません。アプリケーションは以下のことをします:キャッシュの中のエントリを参照しますが、結果としてキャッシュミスになりますデータベースからエントリを取得しますエントリをキャッシュに追加しますエントリを返しますdef get_user(self, user_id):    user = cache.get(\""user.{0}\"", user_id)    if user is None:        user = db.query(\""SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}\"", user_id)        if user is not None:            key = \""user.{0}\"".format(user_id)            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))    return userMemcached は通常このように使われる。その後のキャッシュデータ読み込みは速いです。キャッシュアサイドはレージーローディングであるとも言われます。リクエストされたデータのみがキャッシュされ、リクエストされていないデータでキャッシュが溢れるのを防止します。欠点: キャッシュアサイド各キャッシュミスは三つのトリップを呼び出すことになり、体感できるほどの遅延が起きてしまいます。データベースのデータが更新されるとキャッシュデータは古いものになってしまいます。time-to-live (TTL)を設定することでキャッシュエントリの更新を強制的に行う、もしくはライトスルーを採用することでこの問題は緩和できます。ノードが落ちると、新規の空のノードで代替されることでレイテンシーが増加することになります。ライトスルー      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsアプリケーションはキャッシュをメインのデータストアとして使い、そこにデータの読み書きを行います。一方、キャッシュはデータベースへの読み書きを担当します。アプリケーションはキャッシュにあるエントリを追加・更新しますキャッシュは同期的にデータストアに書き込みを行いますエントリを返しますアプリケーションコード:set_user(12345, {\""foo\"":\""bar\""})キャッシュコード:def set_user(user_id, values):    user = db.query(\""UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}\"", user_id, values)    cache.set(user_id, user)ライトスルーは書き込み処理のせいで全体としては遅いオペレーションですが、書き込まれたばかりのデータに関する読み込みは速いです。ユーザー側は一般的にデータ更新時の方が読み込み時よりもレイテンシーに許容的です。キャッシュ内のデータは最新版で保たれます。欠点: ライトスルーノードが落ちたこと、もしくはスケーリングによって新しいノードが作成された時に、新しいノードはデータベース内のエントリーが更新されるまではエントリーをキャッシュしません。キャッシュアサイドとライトスルーを併用することでこの問題を緩和できます。書き込まれたデータの大部分は一度も読み込まれることはありません。このデータはTTLによって圧縮することができます。ライトビハインド (ライトバック)      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsライトビハインドではアプリケーションは以下のことをします:キャッシュのエントリーを追加・更新しますデータストアへの書き込みを非同期的に行うことで、書き込みパフォーマンスを向上させます。欠点: ライトビハインドキャッシュがデータストア内のコンテンツにヒットする前にキャッシュが落ちるとデータ欠損が起きる可能性があります。キャッシュアサイドやライトスルーよりも実装が複雑になります。リフレッシュアヘッド      Source: From cache to in-memory data grid期限切れよりも前に、直近でアクセスされた全てのキャッシュエントリを自動的に更新するように設定することができます。もしどのアイテムが将来必要になるのかを正確に予測することができるのならば、リードスルーよりもレイテンシーを削減することができます。欠点: リフレッシュアヘッドどのアイテムが必要になるかの予測が正確でない場合にはリフレッシュアヘッドがない方がレイテンシーは良いという結果になってしまいます。欠点: キャッシュcache invalidationなどを用いて、データベースなどの真のデータとキャッシュの間の一貫性を保つ必要があります。Redisやmemcachedを追加することでアプリケーション構成を変更する必要があります。Cache invalidationも難しいですがそれに加えて、いつキャッシュを更新するかという複雑な問題にも悩まされることになります。その他の参考資料、ページFrom cache to in-memory data gridスケーラブルなシステムデザインパターンスケールできるシステムを設計するためのイントロダクションスケーラビリティ、可用性、安定性、パターンスケーラビリティAWS ElastiCacheのストラテジーWikipedia非同期処理      Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale非同期のワークフローはもし、連続的に行われるとリクエスト時間を圧迫してしまうような重い処理を別で処理する手法です。また、定期的にデータを集合させるなどの時間がかかるような処理を前もって処理しておくことにも役立ちます。メッセージキューメッセージキューはメッセージを受け取り、保存し、配信します。もし、処理がインラインで行うには遅すぎる場合、以下のようなワークフローでメッセージキューを用いるといいでしょう:アプリケーションはジョブをキューに配信し、ユーザーにジョブステータスを伝えます。ワーカーがジョブキューから受け取って、処理を行い、終了したらそのシグナルを返します。ユーザーの処理が止まることはなく、ジョブはバックグラウンドで処理されます。この間に、クライアントはオプションとして、タスクが完了したかのように見せるために小規模の処理を行います。例えば、ツイートを投稿するときに、ツイートはすぐにあなたのタイムラインに反映されたように見えますが、そのツイートが実際に全てのフォロワーに配信されるまでにはもう少し時間がかかっているでしょう。Redis はシンプルなメッセージ仲介としてはいいですが、メッセージが失われてしまう可能性があります。RabbitMQ はよく使われていますが、'AMQP'プロトコルに対応して、自前のノードを立てる必要があります。Amazon SQS という選択肢もありますが、レイテンシーが高く、メッセージが重複して配信されてしまう可能性があります。タスクキュータスクキューはタスクとその関連するデータを受け取り、処理した上でその結果を返します。スケジュール管理をできるほか、バックグラウンドでとても重いジョブをこなすこともできます。Celery はスケジューリングとpythonのサポートがあります。バックプレッシャーもし、キューが拡大しすぎると、メモリーよりもキューの方が大きくなりキャッシュミスが起こり、ディスク読み出しにつながり、パフォーマンスが低下することにつながります。バックプレッシャーはキューサイズを制限することで回避することができ、高いスループットを確保しキューにすでにあるジョブについてのレスポンス時間を短縮できます。キューがいっぱいになると、クライアントはサーバービジーもしくはHTTP 503をレスポンスとして受け取りまた後で時間をおいてアクセスするようにメッセージを受け取ります。クライアントはexponential backoffなどによって後ほど再度時間を置いてリクエストすることができます。欠点: 非同期処理キューを用いることで遅延が起こり、複雑さも増すため、あまり重くない計算処理やリアルタイムワークフローにおいては同期処理の方がいいでしょう。その他の参考資料、ページIt's

はクライアントとサーバー間でのデータをエンコードして転送するための手法です。リクエスト・レスポンスに関わるプロトコルです。クライアントがリクエストをサーバーに投げ、サーバーがリクエストに関係するコンテンツと完了ステータス情報をレスポンスとして返します。HTTPは自己完結するので、間にロードバランサー、キャッシュ、エンクリプション、圧縮などのどんな中間ルーターが入っても動くようにできています。基本的なHTTPリクエストはHTTP動詞(メソッド)とリソース(エンドポイント)で成り立っています。以下がよくあるHTTP動詞です。:動詞詳細冪等性*セーフキャッシュできるかGETリソースを読み取るYesYesYesPOSTリソースを作成するもしくはデータを処理するトリガーNoNoYes レスポンスが新しい情報を含む場合PUTリソースを作成もしくは入れ替えるYesNoNoPATCHリソースを部分的に更新するNoNoYes レスポンスが新しい情報を含む場合DELETEリソースを削除するYesNoNo何度呼んでも同じ結果が返ってくることHTTPはTCP や UDP などの低級プロトコルに依存しているアプリケーションレイヤーのプロトコルである。その他の参考資料、ページ: HTTPHTTPってなに?HTTP と TCPの違いPUT と PATCHの違い伝送制御プロトコル (TCP)      Source: How to make a multiplayer gameTCPはIP networkの上で成り立つ接続プロトコルです。接続はhandshakeによって開始、解除されます。全ての送信されたパケットは欠損なしで送信先に送信された順番で到達するように以下の方法で保証されています:シーケンス番号とchecksum fieldsが全てのパケットに用意されているAcknowledgementパケットと自動再送信もし送信者が正しいレスポンスを受け取らなかったとき、パケットを再送信します。複数のタイムアウトがあったとき、接続は解除されます。TCP はフロー制御 と 輻輳制御も実装しています。これらの機能によって速度は低下し、一般的にUDPよりも非効率な転送手段になっています。ハイスループットを実現するために、ウェブサーバーはかなり大きな数のTCP接続を開いておくことがあり、そのことでメモリー使用が圧迫されます。ウェブサーバスレッドと例えばmemcached サーバーの間で多数のコネクションを保っておくことは高くつくかもしれません。可能なところではUDPに切り替えるだけでなくコネクションプーリングなども役立つかもしれません。TCPは高い依存性を要し、時間制約が厳しくないものに適しているでしょう。ウェブサーバー、データベース情報、SMTP、FTPやSSHなどの例に適用されます。以下の時にUDPよりもTCPを使うといいでしょう:全てのデータが欠損することなしに届いてほしいネットワークスループットの最適な自動推測をしてオペレーションしたいユーザデータグラムプロトコル (UDP)      Source: How to make a multiplayer gameUDPはコネクションレスです。データグラム（パケットのようなもの）はデータグラムレベルでの保証しかされません。データグラムは順不同で受け取り先に到着したりそもそも着かなかったりします。UDPは輻輳制御をサポートしません。TCPにおいてはサポートされているこれらの保証がないため、UDPは一般的に、TCPよりも効率的です。UDPはサブネット上のすべての機器にデータグラムを送信することができます。これはDHCP において役に立ちます。というのも、クライアントはまだIPアドレスを取得していないので、IPアドレスを必要とするTCPによるストリームができないからです。UDPは信頼性の面では劣りますが、VoIP、ビデオチャット、ストリーミングや同時通信マルチプレイヤーゲームなどのリアルタイム性が重視される時にはとても効果的です。TCPよりもUDPを使うのは:レイテンシーを最低限に抑えたい時データ欠損よりも、データ遅延を重視するときエラー修正を自前で実装したいときその他の参考資料、ページ: TCP と UDPゲームプログラミングのためのネットワークTCP と UDP プロトコルの主な違いTCP と UDPの違いTransmission control protocolUser datagram protocolFacebookのメムキャッシュスケーリング遠隔手続呼出 (RPC)      Source: Crack the system design interviewRPCではクライアントがリモートサーバーなどの異なるアドレス空間でプロシージャーが処理されるようにします。プロシージャーはローカルでのコールのように、クライアントからサーバーにどのように通信するかという詳細を省いた状態でコードが書かれます。リモートのコールは普通、ローカルのコールよりも遅く、信頼性に欠けるため、RPCコールをローカルコールと区別させておくことが好ましいでしょう。人気のRPCフレームワークは以下です。Protobuf、 Thrift、AvroRPC は リクエストレスポンスプロトコル:クライアントプログラム - クライアントスタブプロシージャーを呼び出します。パラメータはローカルでのプロシージャーコールのようにスタックへとプッシュされていきます。クライアントスタブプロシージャー - プロシージャIDとアーギュメントをパックしてリクエストメッセージにします。クライアント通信モジュール - OSがクライアントからサーバーへとメッセージを送ります。サーバー通信モジュール - OSが受け取ったパケットをサーバースタブプロシージャーに受け渡します。サーバースタブプロシージャー -  結果を展開し、プロシージャーIDにマッチするサーバープロシージャーを呼び出し、結果を返します。サーバーレスポンスは上記のステップを逆順で繰り返します。Sample RPC calls:GET /someoperation?data=anIdPOST /anotheroperation{  \""data\"":\""anId\"";  \""anotherdata\"": \""another value\""}RPCは振る舞いを公開することに焦点を当てています。RPCは内部通信パフォーマンスを理由として使われることが多いです。というのも、使用する状況に合わせてネイティブコールを自作することができるからです。ネイティブライブラリー (aka SDK) を呼ぶのは以下の時:ターゲットのプラットフォームを知っている時ロジックがどのようにアクセスされるのかを管理したいときライブラリー外でエラーがどのようにコントロールされるかを管理したい時パフォーマンスとエンドユーザーエクスペリエンスが最優先の時REST プロトコルに従うHTTP APIはパブリックAPIにおいてよく用いられます。欠点: RPCRPCクライアントとはサービス実装により厳密に左右されることになります。新しいオペレーション、使用例があるたびに新しくAPIが定義されなければなりません。RPCをデバッグするのは難しい可能性があります。既存のテクノロジーをそのまま使ってサービスを構築することはできないかもしれません。例えば、SquidなどのサーバーにRPCコールが正しくキャッシュ されるように追加で骨を折る必要があるかもしれません。Representational state transfer (REST)RESTは、クライアントがサーバーによってマネージされるリソースに対して処理を行うクライアント・サーバーモデルを支持するアーキテキチャスタイルです。サーバーは操作できるもしくは新しいリソースレプレゼンテーションを受け取ることができるようなリソースやアクションのレプレゼンテーションを提供します。すべての通信はステートレスでキャッシュ可能でなければなりません。RESTful なインターフェースには次の四つの特徴があります:特徴的なリソース (URI in HTTP) - どのオペレーションであっても同じURIを使う。HTTP動詞によって変わる (Verbs in HTTP) - 動詞、ヘッダー、ボディを使う自己説明的なエラーメッセージ (status response in HTTP) - ステータスコードを使い、新しく作ったりしないこと。HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - 自分のwebサービスがブラウザで完全にアクセスできること。サンプル REST コール:GET /someresources/anIdPUT /someresources/anId{\""anotherdata\"": \""another value\""}RESTはデータを公開することに焦点を当てています。クライアントとサーバーのカップリングを最小限にするもので、パブリックAPIなどによく用いられます。RESTはURI、 representation through headers、そして、GET、POST、PUT、 DELETE、PATCHなどのHTTP動詞等のよりジェネリックで統一されたメソッドを用います。ステートレスであるのでRESTは水平スケーリングやパーティショニングに最適です。欠点: RESTRESTはデータ公開に焦点を当てているので、リソースが自然に整理されていなかったり、シンプルなヒエラルキーで表せられない時にはよい選択肢とは言えないかもしれません。例えば、とあるイベントのセットにマッチするすべての更新情報を返すと言った処理は簡単にはパスで表現することができません。RESTでは、URIパス、クエリパラメータ、そして場合によってはリクエストボディなどによって実装されることが多いでしょう。RESTは少数の動詞に依存しています(GET、POST、PUT、DELETE、そして PATCH) が時には使いたい事例に合わないことがあります。例えば、期限の切れたドキュメントをアーカイブに移したい場合などはこれらの動詞の中には綺麗にはフィットしません。ネストされたヒエラルキーの中にあるリソースをとってくるのはシングルビューを描画するのにクライアントとサーバー間で数回やりとりしなければなりません。例として、ブログエントリーのコンテンツとそれに対するコメントを表示する場合などです。様々なネットワーク環境で動作する可能性が考えられるモバイルアプリケーションにおいてはこのような複数のやり取りは好ましくありません。時が経つにつれて、APIレスポンスにより多くのフィールドが与えられて、古いクライアントはすでにいらないものも含めてすべてのデータフィールドを受け取ることになります。そのことで、ペイロードが大きくなりすぎて、レイテンシーも拡大することになります。RPCとREST比較OperationRPCRESTサインアップPOST

58,keras-team/keras,https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/README.md,Python,"Keras: Deep Learning for humansThis repository hosts the development of the Keras library.Read the documentation at keras.io.About KerasKeras is a deep learning API written in Python,running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation andproviding a delightful developer experience.The purpose of Keras is to give an unfair advantage to any developer looking to ship ML-powered apps.Keras is:Simple -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive loadto free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.Keras focuses on ease of use, debugging speed, code elegance & conciseness,maintainability, and deployability (via TFServing, TFLite, TF.js).Flexible -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure ofcomplexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarilyadvanced workflows should be possible via a clear path that builds uponwhat you've already learned.Powerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance andscalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA,YouTube, and Waymo. That's right -- your YouTube recommendations arepowered by Keras, and so is the world's most advanced driverless vehicle.Keras & TensorFlow 2TensorFlow 2 is an end-to-end, open-source machine learning platform.You can think of it as an infrastructure layer fordifferentiable programming.It combines four key abilities:Efficiently executing low-level tensor operations on CPU, GPU, or TPU.Computing the gradient of arbitrary differentiable expressions.Scaling computation to many devices, such as clusters of hundreds of GPUs.Exporting programs (\""graphs\"") to external runtimes such as servers, browsers, mobile and embedded devices.Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interfacefor solving machine learning problems,with a focus on modern deep learning. It provides essential abstractions and building blocks for developingand shipping machine learning solutions with high iteration velocity.Keras empowers engineers and researchers to take full advantage of the scalabilityand cross-platform capabilities of TensorFlow 2: you can run Keras on TPU or on large clusters of GPUs,and you can export your Keras models to run in the browser or on a mobile device.First contact with KerasThe core data structures of Keras are layers and models.The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers.For more complex architectures, you should use the Keras functional API,which allows you to build arbitrary graphs of layers or write models entirely from scratch via subclassing.Here is the Sequential model:from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequentialmodel = Sequential()Stacking layers is as easy as .add():from tensorflow.keras.layers import Densemodel.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu'))model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))Once your model looks good, configure its learning process with .compile():model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',              optimizer='sgd',              metrics=['accuracy'])If you need to, you can further configure your optimizer. The Keras philosophy is to keep simple things simple,while allowing the user to be fully in control when they need to be (the ultimate control being the easy extensibility of the source code via subclassing).model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,              optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(                  learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True))You can now iterate on your training data in batches:# x_train and y_train are Numpy arrays.model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)Evaluate your test loss and metrics in one line:loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)Or generate predictions on new data:classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)What you just saw is the most elementary way to use Keras.However, Keras is also a highly-flexible framework suitable to iterate on state-of-the-art research ideas.Keras follows the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: it makes it easy to get started,yet it makes it possible to handle arbitrarily advanced use cases,only requiring incremental learning at each step.In pretty much the same way that you were able to train & evaluate a simple neural network above in a few lines,you can use Keras to quickly develop new training procedures or exotic model architectures.Here's a low-level training loop example, combining Keras functionality with the TensorFlow GradientTape:import tensorflow as tf# Prepare an optimizer.optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()# Prepare a loss function.loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.kl_divergence# Iterate over the batches of a dataset.for inputs, targets in dataset:    # Open a GradientTape.    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:        # Forward pass.        predictions = model(inputs)        # Compute the loss value for this batch.        loss_value = loss_fn(targets, predictions)    # Get gradients of loss wrt the weights.    gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_weights)    # Update the weights of the model.    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_weights))For more in-depth tutorials about Keras, you can check out:Introduction to Keras for engineersIntroduction to Keras for researchersDeveloper guidesOther learning resourcesInstallationKeras comes packaged with TensorFlow 2 as tensorflow.keras.To start using Keras, simply install TensorFlow 2.You can then import Keras as follows:from tensorflow import kerasRelease and compatibilityKeras has nightly releases (keras-nightly on PyPI)and stable releases (keras on PyPI).The nightly Keras releases are usually compatible with the corresponding versionof the tf-nightly releases(e.g. keras-nightly==2.7.0.dev2021100607 should beused with tf-nightly==2.7.0.dev2021100607).We don't maintain backward compatibility for nightly releases.For stable releases, each Kerasversion maps to a specific stable version of TensorFlow.The table below shows the compatibility version mappingbetween TensorFlow versions and Keras versions.All the release branches can be found on GitHub.All the release binaries can be found on Pypi.SupportYou can ask questions and join the development discussion:In the TensorFlow forum.On the Keras mailing list.Opening an issueYou can also post bug reports and feature requests (only)in GitHub issues.Opening a PRWe welcome contributions!

This is a playground, and we encourage failing often. Use this as a practice ground, and enjoy contributing to projects you create with your fellow students. Many students have gained real-world experience \""working in teams\"" by working on these projects.A Guide to Get Started (used to be the 4 step guide)Check out Andrei's videos on github if you haven't watched it already.On the GitHub page for this repository, click on the button \""Fork.\""Clone your forked repository to your computer:For example, run this command inside your terminal:git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/start-here-guidelines.gitReplace <your-github-username>!Learn more about forking and cloning a repo.Move to project directory:cd start-here-guidelinesBefore you make any changes, keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts:git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines.gitgit pull upstream masterIf you run into a merge conflict, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can watch this tutorial.After adding the upstream and checking that all files are up to date, we now will create new branch before editing any files. There are two ways to do so:git checkout -b <branch-name>git branch <branch-name>git switch <branch-name>On your computer, open your text editor, and add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE #1: Add your name somewhere in the middle. Not at the top or bottom in order to avoid the chance of you getting a merge conflict!⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Please do NOT edit or remove other people from the list, even to fix their indentation etc. This will likely prevent your PR from being merged.Add the changes with git add, git commit (write a good commit message, if possible):git add CONTRIBUTORS.mdgit commit -m \""Add <your-github-username>\""Replace <your-github-username>!Push your changes to your repository:git push origin <branch-name>Go to the GitHub page of your fork, and make a pull request:Read more about pull requests on the GitHub help pages.Wait until Zerobot or one of the maintainers merges your pull request. If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification and be required to resolve the conflict.Go join a project and start contributing or create your own group apps. Don't be shy and enjoy creating things together (We have over 20 projects for all levels of programmers)! Check out this guide for more information on selecting a project.To see the Zero to Mastery Icon in your GitHub profile, follow these steps (you must complete steps 1 and 2 for this to work).Anatomy of an open-source project:Every open-source community is different.Spending years on one open-source project means you’ve gotten to know one open-source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.That being said, many open-source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.A typical open-source project has the following types of people:Author: The person(s) or organization that created the project.Owner: The person(s) who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author).Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (may also be authors or owners of the project).Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page or in the repository for governance documentation to find this information.A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.LICENSE: By definition, every open-source project must have an open-source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.Other documentation: There might be additional documentation such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.Finally, open-source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Discord or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.Get all the ZTM Courses, for one monthly subscription here."

DevOps 帮助我们完成什么?DevOps 的反模式是什么?什么是持续集成?开发人员经常将代码集成到共享仓库中的一种开发实践。 它的范围可以从每天或每周进行几次更改，到大规模在一个小时内进行几次更改。验证每段代码（更改/补丁），以使更改可以安全地合并。 如今，使用自动构建来确保代码可以集成的测试更改是一种常见的做法。 它可以是一个运行在不同级别（单元，功能等）的多个测试的构建，也可以是所有或某些必须通过以将更改合并到存储库中的多个单独的构建。什么是持续部署?什么是持续交付?你认为CI / CD的最佳做法是什么?你将用于以下哪些系统和/或工具？：CI/CD基础架构配置管理监控 & 报警日志代码审查代码覆盖率测试集CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis基础架构 - Terraform, CloudFormation配置管理 - Ansible, Puppet, Chef监控 & 报警 - Prometheus, Nagios日志 - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd代码审查 - Gerrit, Review Board代码覆盖率 - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo测试集 - Robot, Serenity, Gauge你在选择工具/技术时是怎么考虑的?你可以使用以下一项或全部：   * 成熟与尖端   * 社区规模   * 体系结构方面-代理与无代理，主控与无主控等解释可变基础架构与不变基础架构在可变的基础架构原则中，更改将应用到现有基础架构之上并随着时间的推移而变化基础架构建立了变化的历史。 Ansible，Puppet和Chef这些工具遵循可变的基础架构原则。在不变的基础架构原则中，每项更改实际上都是新的基础架构。 所以改变到服务器将导致新服务器而不是更新服务器。 Terraform是遵循不变的基础架构原则的一个例子。你熟悉什么方式来交付软件?  * 存档 - 将你所有的应用文件收集到一个存档中（例如tar），并将其交付给用户。  * 打包 - 取决于操作系统，你可以使用OS软件包格式（例如，在RHEL / Fefodra中为RPM）来交付软件，并使用标准打包程序命令来安装，卸载和更新它  * 映像 - VM或容器映像，其中包已包含在其中，以便成功运行。什么是缓存? 缓存是怎么工作的? 为什么缓存很重要?解释一下无状态和有状态什么是HTTP及其工作方式?描述一下设置某些类型的Web服务器的工作流程 (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)解释一下监控. 它是什么?

Python注重可读性，并使用空格/缩进代替括号{}5. python 包管理器称为PIP“ pip install packages”，具有超过200.000可用的软件包。6. Python 附带安装了pip和一个大的标准库，为程序员提供了许多预置的解决方案。7. 在python中，“一切”都是一个对象。还有许多其他特性，但这是每个python程序员都应该知道的主要特性。Python支持哪些数据类型，哪些是可变的？ 如何显示某个数据类型是可变的?可变数据类型是:ListDictionarySet不可变数据类型是:Numbers (int, float, ...)StringBoolTupleFrozenset通常，你可以使用函数hash（）来检查对象的可变性，如果它是可哈希的，则是不可变的，尽管由于用户定义的对象可能是可变的且可哈希的，所以它并不总是按预期工作什么是PEP8? 举例说明3种风格指南PEP8是Python的编码约定和样式指南的列表5 种样式指南:将所有行限制为最多79个字符。用两个空行包围顶级函数和类定义。制作一个元素的元组时使用逗号使用空格（而不是制表符）进行缩进每个缩进级别使用4个空格解释一下继承以及如何在Python中使用它根据定义，继承是一种机制，其中一个对象充当另一个对象的基础，并保留其所有对象属性。因此，如果B类继承自A类，那么A类的每个特征也将在B类中提供。A类将是“基类”，B类将是“派生类”。当你有几个共享相同功能的类时，这很方便。基本语法:class Base: passclass Derived(Base): passA more forged example:class Animal:    def __init__(self):        print(\""and I'm alive!\"")    def eat(self, food):        print(\""ñom ñom ñom\"", food)class Human(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is ', name)        super().__init__()    def write_poem(self):        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')class Dog(Animal):    def __init__(self, name):        print('My name is', name)        super().__init__()    def bark(self):        print('woof woof')michael = Human('Michael')michael.eat('Spam')michael.write_poem()bruno = Dog('Bruno')bruno.eat('bone')bruno.bark()>>> My name is  Michael>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!>>> My name is Bruno>>> and I'm alive!>>> ñom ñom ñom bone>>> woof woof调用super（）会调用Base方法，因此，调用super().__init__() 就是调用 Animal__init__。有一个称为 MetaClasses 的更高级的python功能，可帮助程序员直接控制类的创建。 什么是一个错误? 什么是一个异常? 你熟悉哪些异常类型?＃ 请注意，你通常不需要了解编译过程，而只需知道一切都来自哪里＃ 并给出完整的答案表明你真正知道你在说什么。通常，每个编译过程都有两个步骤。    - 分析    - 产生代码.        Analysis can be broken into:        1. 词法分析   (标记源代码)        2. 语法分析 (如果语法正确，请检查标记是否合法，tldr)                          for i in 'foo'                          ^             SyntaxError: invalid syntax                We missed ':'                        3. 语义分析  (上下文分析，合法语法仍然会触发错误，你是否尝试过除以0，哈希可变对象或使用未声明的函数?)                           1/0                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero            这三个分析步骤负责错误处理。        第二步将负责错误，主要是语法错误，这是最常见的错误。    第三步将负责异常。        如我们所见，异常是语义错误，有许多内置的异常：        ImportError        ValueError        KeyError        FileNotFoundError        IndentationError        IndexError        ...        你还可以具有用户定义的异常，这些异常必须直接或间接地从Exception类继承。    常见例子:            class DividedBy2Error(Exception):        def __init__(self, message):            self.message = message            def division(dividend,divisor):        if divisor == 2:            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')        return dividend / divisor        division(100, 2)        >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!解释 异常处理以及如何在Python中使用它编写一个可以恢复字符串的程序（例如，pizza -> azzip）最简单的是 str[::-1] 但不是效率最高的.\""经典\"" 方式:foo = ''for char in 'pizza':    foo = char + foo>> 'azzip'   编写一个函数以返回一个或多个数字的和。 用户将决定要使用多少个数字首先，你询问用户要使用的数字量。 使用while循环，每个循环将amount_of_numbers减1，直到amount_of_numbers变为0。 在while循环中，你想询问用户一个数字，该数字将在每次循环运行时添加一个变量。def return_sum():\tamount_of_numbers = int(input(\""How many numbers? \""))\ttotal_sum = 0\twhile amount_of_numbers != 0:\t\tnum = int(input(\""Input a number. \""))\t\ttotal_sum += num\t\tamount_of_numbers -= 1\treturn total_sum如何将两个排序列表合并为一个排序列表? _ 在 Python 中用于什么?i18n中的翻译查询将最后执行的表达式或语句的结果保存在交互式解释器中。作为通用“可丢弃”变量名。 例如：x，y，_ = get_data（）（使用了x和y，但是由于我们不关心第三个变量，因此我们将其“扔掉了”）。Algorithms Implementation你可以在Python中实现“二分法搜索”吗?Files如何写文件?with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:    file.write(\""My insightful comment\"")如何反转文件?Regex如何在Python中执行与正则表达式相关的操作？ （匹配模式，替代字符串等）使用 re 模式如何用 \""blue\"" 替换字符串 \""green\""?如何找到一个变量中的所有IP地址？ 如何在文件中找到它们?按每个嵌套列表的第二项对列表列表进行排序li = [[1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 9], [4, 2], [4, 5]]sorted(x, key=lambda l: l[1])你可以编写一个函数来打印给定目录中的所有文件吗？ 包括子目录你有下面的列表: [{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]  获取所有的食物类型，最后输出: {'mushrooms', 'goombas', 'turtles'}brothers_menu =  \\[{'name': 'Mario', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'goombas']}, {'name': 'Luigi', 'food': ['mushrooms', 'turtles']}]# \""经典\"" 方式def get_food(brothers_menu) -> set:    temp = []    for brother in brothers_menu:        for food in brother['food']:            temp.append(food)    return set(temp)# 一直先行方式 (Using list comprehension)set([food for bro in x for food in bro['food']])什么是List 加强？ 它比典型的循环更好吗？ 为什么？ 你能示范如何使用它吗?怎样反转 string?最简短的方式是: my_string[::-1] 但是这不是效率最高的. 经典方式是:def reverse_string(string):    temp = \""\""    for char in string:        temp =  char + temp    return temp如何按值对字典排序?如何按键对字典排序?解释数据序列化以及如何使用Python执行你如何在Python中处理参数解析?解释什么是GIL什么是迭代器? 为什么使用迭代器?解释以下方法的类型以及如何使用它们:Static methodClass methodinstance method怎样反转 list?空的 return 返回什么?Time Complexity描述操作的时间复杂度access, search insert and remove 下面的数据结构:StackQueueLinked ListBinary Search Tree以下算法的最好，最差和平均情况的复杂度是什么?:QuicksortMergesortBucket SortRadix Sort  高级解释什么是装饰器你能展示如何编写和使用装饰器吗?编写脚本来确定给定端口上是否可以访问给定主机这个查询熟悉数据类吗？ 你能解释一下他们是干什么用的吗?解释一下上下文管理解释一下缓冲协议解释一下描述符你有抓取网络（爬虫）的经验吗？ 你能描述一下你用过什么以及用什么?你可以在Python中实现链接链表吗?你已经创建了一个网页，用户可以在其中上传文档。 但是，根据文档大小，读取上传文件的功能会运行很长时间，并且用户必须等待读取操作完成才能继续使用该网站。 你怎么能解决这个问题?Prometheus初级什么是Prometheus? Prometheus的主要特点是什么?描述 Prometheus 架构和组件你能否将 Prometheus 与其他解决方案（例如InfluxDB）进行比较?什么是an Alert?描述以下Prometheus组件:Prometheus serverPush GatewayAlert Manager负责抓取存储数据的Prometheus服务器推送网关用于短期作业警报管理负责警报 ;）什么是一个实例? 什么是一个作业?Prometheus支持哪些核心指标类型?什么是一个 exporter? 它用来做什么?你熟悉哪些Prometheus最佳做法？ 至少命名三个如何在给定时间内获得总请求?高级你如何加入两个指标?如何编写返回标签值的查询?如何将cpu_user_seconds转换为cpu使用率（百分比）?Git初级git pull 和 git fetch的区别是什么?简单来说, git pull = git fetch + git merge当你运行git pull时，它会从远程或中央获取所有更改存储库，并将其附加到本地存储库中的相应分支。git fetch从远程存储库获取所有更改，将更改存储在本地存储库中的单独分支解释以下: git 目录, 工作目录 和 暂存区Git目录是Git存储项目的元数据和对象数据库的地方。 这是Git最重要的部分，当你从另一台计算机克隆存储库时，它就是复制的。工作目录是项目一个版本的单个签出。 这些文件将从Git目录中的压缩数据库中拉出，并放置在磁盘上供你使用或修改。暂存区是一个简单文件，通常包含在你的Git目录中，用于存储有关下一次提交的内容的信息。 有时称为索引，但将其称为暂存区已成为标准。答案来自 git-scm.com怎么解决 git merge 冲突?首先，打开有冲突的文件，然后确定有什么冲突。接下来，根据你的公司或团队接受的是什么，你可以与自己的同事解决冲突或自行解决解决冲突后，使用 git add  添加文件。最后，运行`git rebase --continue`。git reset 和 git revert区别是什么?git revert 创建一个新的提交，撤消上一次提交的更改。git reset 根据使用情况，可以修改索引或更改分支头当前指向的提交。你想将提交移至顶部。 你将如何实现?使用 git rebase> 命令那种情形你会使用 git rebase?你熟悉哪些合并策略?提及两个或三个就足够了，最好提到“递归”作为默认值。recursiveresolveourstheirs这篇文章解释是最好的: https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies在提交更改之前，如何查看已完成的更改?git diff如何将特定文件还原为先前的提交?git checkout HEAD~1 -- /path/of/the/file高级解释 Git octopus merge也许不错，它是：对于合并多个分支的情况（以及此类用例的默认情况）非常有用  * 主要用于将主题分支捆绑在一起有一篇文章关于 Octopus merge: http://www.freblogg.com/2016/12/git-octopus-merge.htmlGo初级Go编程语言有哪些特点?强类型和静态类型 - 变量的类型不能随时间更改，必须在编译时进行定义  * 简单  * 快速编译时间  * 内置并发  * 垃圾回收  * 平台无关  * 编译为独立的二进制文件 - 你运行应用程序所需的所有内容都将被编译为一个二进制文件。 对于运行时的版本管理非常有用。Go 而且有一个很好的社区.var x int = 2 和 x := 2区别是什么?结果相同，变量值为2。with var x int = 2 we are setting the variable type to integer while with x := 2 we are letting Go figure out by itself the type.对还是错? 在Go中，我们可以重新声明变量，并且一旦声明就必须使用它.错. 我们不能重新声明变量，必须使用声明的变量。你使用了哪些Go库?应该根据你的使用情况回答此问题，一些示例是：fmt - formatted I/O下面代码块有什么问题? 怎么解决?func main() {    var x float32 = 13.5    var y int    y = x}下面的代码块尝试将整数101转换为字符串，但相反，我们得到“ e”。 这是为什么？ 怎么解决?package mainimport \""fmt\""func main() {    var x int = 101    var y string    y = string(x)    fmt.Println(y)}它看起来在101处设置了什么unicode值，并将其用于将整数转换为字符串。如果要获取“ 101”，则应使用“ strconv” 软件包，然后替换 y = string(x) with y = strconv.Itoa(x)以下代码块什么是错的?:package mainfunc main() {    var x = 2    var y = 3    const someConst = x + y}以下代码块的输出是什么？:package mainimport \""fmt\""const (\tx = iota\ty = iota)const z = iotafunc main() {\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", x)\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", y)\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", z)} _ 在 Go 中的用途是什么?以下代码块的输出是什么？:package mainimport \""fmt\""const (\t_ = iota + 3\tx)func main() {\tfmt.Printf(\""%v\\"", x)}Mongo初级MongoDB有什么优势？ 换句话说，为什么选择 MongoDB 而不选择 NoSQL 的其他实现?SQL和NoSQL之间的区别是什么?主要区别在于SQL数据库是结构化的（数据以带有行和列的表格-像是Excel电子表格表格），而NoSQL是非结构化的，并且数据存储会根据NoSQL DB的设置方式而有所不同，例如作为键值对，面向文档等在哪种情况下，这个查询希望使用 NoSQL/Mongo 而不是SQL?经常变化的异构数据  * 数据一致性和完整性不是重中之重  * 最好，如果数据库需要快速扩展什么是一个文档? 什么是一个集合?什么是一个聚合?那个更好? 嵌入文档还是引用?Queries解释这个查询: db.books.find({\""name\"": /abc/})解释这个查询: db.books.find().sort({x:1})OpenShift初级什么是OpenShift? 你用过吗？ 如果有，是怎样使用的？你能解释一下 OpenShift 和 Kubernetes 之间的区别吗?定义 Pods 以及解释什么是有状态的 pods你熟悉哪些类型的构建策略?解释标签是什么以及它们的用途解释什么是注释以及它们与标签的区别解释什么是Downward APIShell 脚本初级告诉我你使用Shell脚本的经验脚本中的这一行是什么意思?: #!/bin/bash你倾向于在编写的每个脚本中包含什么?对还是错?: 当某个命令行失败时，默认情况下，该脚本将退出并且不会继续运行取决于所使用的语言和设置，例如在Bash中，默认情况下，脚本将继续运行。今天，我们拥有Ansible之类的工具和技术。 为什么还会有人使用Shell脚本?说出下面每个命令的结果是什么：echo $0echo $?echo $$echo $@echo $#你如何调试Shell脚本?如何在Shell脚本中从用户获得输入?解释一下条件语句以及如何使用它们什么是循环? 你熟悉哪些类型的循环?解释 continue 和 break. 你什么时候使用它们?如何将命令的输出存储在变量中?你如何检查可变长度?单引号和双引号之间的区别是什么?高级解释以下代码::(){ :|:& };:你能举一些Bash最佳实践的例子吗?什么是三元运算符？ 你如何在bash中使用它?使用 if/else 的一种简短方法。 一个例子:[[ $a = 1 ]] && b=\""yes, equal\"" || b=\""nope\""SQL初级SQL 代表什么?Structured Query Language（结构化查询语言）SQL 和 NoSQL 有那些不同主要区别在于SQL数据库是结构化的（数据以带有行和列的表格-像是Excel电子表格表格），而NoSQL是非结构化的，并且数据存储会根据NoSQL DB的设置方式而有所不同，例如作为键值对，面向文档等数据库符合ACID的含义是什么?ACID代表原子性，一致性，隔离性，耐久性。为了符合ACID，数据库必须满足四个标准中的每个标准原子性 - 数据库发生更改时，它整体上应该成功或失败。例如，如果你要更新表，则更新应完全执行。如果仅部分执行，则更新被视为整体失败，并且不会通过-数据库将恢复为原始状态更新发生之前的状态。还应该提到的是，原子性确保每个事务以其自身的独立“单元”完成 - 如果任何部分失败，则整个语句都会失败。一致性 - 对数据库所做的任何更改都应将其从一种有效状态转变为另一种有效状态。例如，如果你对数据库进行了更改，则不应破坏它。通过检查和约束来保持一致性在数据库中预定义。例如，如果你尝试将列的值从字符串更改为int应该是数据类型字符串，一致的数据库将不允许该事务通过，并且该操作将不执行隔离 - 确保数据库不会被“更新中”-因为多个事务正在运行同时，它仍应保持数据库处于与按顺序运行事务相同的状态。例如，假设有20个人同时对数据库进行了更改。在当你执行查询时，已完成20项更改中的15项，但仍有5项正在进行中。你应该仅看到已完成的15个更改 - 随着更改的进行，你将看不到数据库的更新中。耐用性 - 更改一旦提交，无论发生什么情况都将保持提交状态（电源故障，系统崩溃等）。这意味着所有已完成的交易必须记录在非挥发性内存中。请注意，SQL本质上符合ACID。某些NoSQL DB可能符合ACID，具体取决于它们的工作方式，但是根据一般经验，NoSQL DB不被视为符合ACID什么时候最好使用SQL/NoSQL？SQL - 当数据完整性至关重要时，最适合使用。 由于符合ACID，SQL通常由许多业务实现特别是金融领域。NoSQL - 非常适合你需要快速扩展的情况。 请记住NoSQL是为Web应用程序设计的，如果你需要快速将相同信息散布到多台服务器，它将会很好的用此外，由于 NoSQL 不遵守具有列和行结构的严格表关系数据库所要求的，你可以将不同的数据类型存储在一起。什么是笛卡尔积?笛卡尔积是指第一个表中的所有行都与第二个表中的所有行连接在一起时的结果表。 这可以通过不定义要联接的键来隐式完成，也可以通过以下方式显式地完成：在两个表上调用CROSS JOIN，如下所示：Select * from customers CROSS JOIN orders;请注意，笛卡尔积也可能是一件坏事 - 执行联接时在两个都没有唯一键的表上，这可能会导致返回信息是不正确的。SQL Specific Questions对于这些问题，我们将使用下面显示的“客户和订单”表：CustomersCustomer_IDCustomer_NameItems_in_cartCash_spent_to_Date100204John Smith020.00100205Jane Smith340.00100206Bobby Frank1100.20ORDERSCustomer_IDOrder_IDItemPriceDate_sold100206A123Rubber Ducky2.202019-09-18100206A123Bubble Bath8.002019-09-18100206Q98780-Pack TP90.002019-09-20100205Z001Cat Food - Tuna Fish10.002019-08-05100205Z001Cat Food - Chicken10.002019-08-05100205Z001Cat Food - Beef10.002019-08-05100205Z001Cat Food - Kitty quesadilla10.002019-08-05100204X202Coffee20.002019-04-29我如何从该表中选择所有字段?Select * From Customers;约翰的购物车中有几件？Select Items_in_cart From Customers Where Customer_Name = \""John Smith\"";所有客户花费的所有现金的总和是多少?Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH From Customers;在购物车有商品的有多少人?Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items From Customers where Items_in_cart > 0;你如何将客户表加入订单表?你可以加入他们的唯一键。 在这种情况下，唯一键为中的Customer_ID客户表和订单表你如何显示哪些客户订购了哪些物品?Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item From Customers c Left Join Orders o On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;高级使用with语句，你将如何显示谁订购了猫粮以及花费的总金额?with cat_food as ( Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE From Orders Where Item like \""%Cat Food%\"" Group by Customer_ID ) Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE From Customers c Inner JOIN cat_food f ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);尽管这是一个简单的声明，但“ with”子句在在连接到另一个表之前，需要在一个表上运行一个复杂的查询。 用语句很好，因为你在运行查询时会创建一个伪临时文件，而不是创建一个新表。目前尚无法获得所有猫粮的总和，因此我们使用了with语句来创建伪表检索每个客户花费的价格总和，然后正常加入该表。Azure初级解释一下可用性集和可用性区域什么是Azure资源管理器？ 你可以描述ARM模板的格式吗？解释一下Azure托管磁盘GCP初级GCP的主要组件和服务是什么?你熟悉哪些GCP管理工具?告诉我对GCP联网了解多少OpenStack初级告诉我你使用OpenStack的经验。 你认为OpenStack的优缺点是什么?你熟悉OpenStack的哪些组件/项目?你能告诉我以下每个组件/项目负责什么吗?:NovaNeutronCinderGlanceKeystone详细描述如何使用可以从云外部访问的IP来启动实例你收到客户打来的电话，说：“我可以ping我的实例，但不能连接（ssh）它”。 可能是什么问题？OpenStack支持哪些类型的网络？你如何调试OpenStack存储问题？ （工具，日志等）你如何调试OpenStack计算问题？ （工具，日志等）你熟悉 TripleO吗?

いえ、ここにあるすべてをやる必要はありません。面接で何を聞かれるかは以下の条件によって変わってきます:どれだけの技術経験があるかあなたの技術背景が何であるかどのポジションのために面接を受けているかどの企業の面接を受けているか運より経験のある候補者は一般的にシステム設計についてより深い知識を有していることを要求されるでしょう。システムアーキテクトやチームリーダーは各メンバーの持つような知識よりは深い見識を持っているべきでしょう。一流テック企業では複数回の設計面接を課されることが多いです。まずは広く始めて、そこからいくつかの分野に絞って深めていくのがいいでしょう。様々なシステム設計のトピックについて少しずつ知っておくことはいいことです。以下の学習ガイドを自分の学習に当てられる時間、技術経験、どの職位、どの会社に応募しているかなどを加味して自分用に調整して使うといいでしょう。短期間

自分で会話を組み立てることを求められます。以下のステップに従って議論を組み立てることができるでしょう。この過程を確かなものにするために、次のセクションシステム設計課題例とその解答 を以下の指針に従って読み込むといいでしょう。ステップ 1: そのシステム使用例の概要、制約、推計値等を聞き出し、まとめるシステム仕様の要求事項を聞き出し、問題箇所を特定しましょう。使用例と制約を明確にするための質問を投げかけましょう。要求する推計値についても議論しておきましょう。誰がそのサービスを使うのか？どのように使うのか？何人のユーザーがいるのか？システムはどのような機能を果たすのか？システムへの入力と出力は？どれだけの容量のデータを捌く必要があるのか？一秒間に何リクエストの送信が想定されるか？読み書き比率の推定値はいくら程度か？ステップ 2: より高レベルのシステム設計を組み立てる重要なコンポーネントを全て考慮した高レベルのシステム設計概要を組み立てる。主要なコンポーネントと接続をスケッチして書き出す考えの裏付けをするステップ 3: 核となるコンポーネントを設計するそれぞれの主要なコンポーネントについての詳細を学ぶ。例えば、url短縮サービスの設計を問われた際には次のようにするといいでしょう:元のURLのハッシュ化したものを作り、それを保存するMD5 と Base62ハッシュ衝突SQL もしくは NoSQLデータベーススキーマハッシュ化されたURLを元のURLに再翻訳するデータベース参照API & オブジェクト指向の設計ステップ 4: システム設計のスケール与えられた制約条件からボトルネックとなりそうなところを割り出し、明確化する。  例えば、スケーラビリティの問題解決のために以下の要素を考慮する必要があるだろうか？ロードバランサー水平スケーリングキャッシングデータベースシャーディング取りうる解決策とそのトレードオフについて議論をしよう。全てのことはトレードオフの関係にある。ボトルネックについてはスケーラブルなシステム設計の原理を読むといいでしょう。ちょっとした暗算問題ちょっとした推計値を手計算ですることを求められることもあるかもしれません。補遺の以下の項目が役に立つでしょう:チラ裏計算でシステム設計する2の乗数表全てのプログラマーが知っておくべきレイテンシの参考値文献とその他の参考資料以下のリンク先ページを見てどのような質問を投げかけられるか概要を頭に入れておきましょう:システム設計面接で成功するには？システム設計面接アーキテクチャ、システム設計面接への導入システム設計課題例とその解答頻出のシステム設計面接課題と参考解答、コード及びダイアグラム解答は

まずはここからシステム設計の勉強は初めて？まず初めに、よく使われる設計原理について、それらが何であるか、どのように用いられるか、長所短所について基本的な知識を得る必要がありますステップ 1:

スケーラビリティに関する資料を読んで復習するスケーラビリティここで触れられているトピックス:クローンデータベースキャッシュ非同期次のステップ次に、ハイレベルでのトレードオフについてみていく:パフォーマンス vs スケーラビリティレイテンシ vs スループット可用性 vs 一貫性全てはトレードオフの関係にあるというのを肝に命じておきましょう。それから、より深い内容、DNSやCDNそしてロードバランサーなどについて学習を進めていきましょう。パフォーマンス vs スケーラビリティリソースが追加されるのにつれて パフォーマンス が向上する場合そのサービスは スケーラブル であると言えるでしょう。一般的に、パフォーマンスを向上させるというのはすなわち計算処理を増やすことを意味しますが、データセットが増えた時などより大きな処理を捌けるようになることでもあります。1パフォーマンスvsスケーラビリティをとらえる他の考え方:パフォーマンス での問題を抱えている時、あなたのシステムは一人のユーザーにとって遅いと言えるでしょう。スケーラビリティ

全ての読み込みは最新の書き込みもしくはエラーを受け取る可用性 - 受け取る情報が最新のものだという保証はないが、全てのリクエストはレスポンスを必ず受け取る分断耐性 - ネットワーク問題によって順不同の分断が起きてもシステムが動作を続けるネットワークは信頼できないので、分断耐性は必ず保証しなければなりません。つまりソフトウェアシステムとしてのトレードオフは、一貫性を取るか、可用性を取るかを考えなければなりません。CP - 一貫性と分断耐性(consistency and partition tolerance)分断されたノードからのレスポンスを待ち続けているとタイムアウトエラーに陥る可能性があります。CPはあなたのサービスがアトミックな読み書き（不可分操作）を必要とする際にはいい選択肢でしょう。AP - 可用性と分断耐性(availability and partition tolerance)レスポンスはノード上にあるデータで最新のものを返します。つまり、最新版のデータが返されるとは限りません。分断が解消された後も、書き込みが反映されるのには時間がかかります。結果整合性　を求めるサービスの際にはAPを採用するのがいいでしょう。もしくは、外部エラーに関わらずシステムが稼働する必要がある際にも同様です。その他の参考資料、ページCAP 理論を振り返る平易な英語でのCAP 理論のイントロCAP FAQ一貫性パターン同じデータの複製が複数ある状態では、クライアントが一貫したデータ表示を受け取るために、どのようにそれらを同期すればいいのかという課題があります。 CAP 理論 における一貫性の定義を思い出してみましょう。全ての読み取りは最新の書き込みデータもしくはエラーを受け取るはずです。弱い一貫性書き込み後の読み取りでは、その最新の書き込みを読めたり読めなかったりする。ベストエフォート型のアプローチに基づく。このアプローチはmemcachedなどのシステムに見られます。弱い一貫性はリアルタイム性が必要なユースケース、例えばVoIP、ビデオチャット、リアルタイムマルチプレイヤーゲームなどと相性がいいでしょう。例えば、電話に出ているときに数秒間音声が受け取れなくなったとしたら、その後に接続が回復してもその接続が切断されていた間に話されていたことは聞き取れないというような感じです。結果整合性書き込みの後、読み取りは最終的にはその結果を読み取ることができる(ミリ秒ほど遅れてというのが一般的です)。データは非同期的に複製されます。このアプローチはDNSやメールシステムなどに採用されています。結果整合性は多くのリクエストを捌くサービスと相性がいいでしょう。強い一貫性書き込みの後、読み取りはそれを必ず読むことができます。データは同期的に複製されます。このアプローチはファイルシステムやRDBMSなどで採用されています。トランザクションを扱うサービスでは強い一貫性が必要でしょう。その他の参考資料、ページデータセンター間でのトランザクション可用性パターン高い可用性を担保するには主に次の二つのパターンがあります: フェイルオーバー と レプリケーション です。フェイルオーバーアクティブ・パッシブアクティブ・パッシブフェイルオーバーにおいては、周期信号はアクティブもしくはスタンバイ中のパッシブなサーバーに送られます。周期信号が中断された時には、パッシブだったサーバーがアクティブサーバーのIPアドレスを引き継いでサービスを再開します。起動までのダウンタイムはパッシブサーバーが「ホット」なスタンバイ状態にあるか、「コールド」なスタンバイ状態にあるかで変わります。アクティブなサーバーのみがトラフィックを捌きます。アクティブ・パッシブフェイルオーバーはマスター・スレーブフェイルオーバーと呼ばれることもあります。アクティブ・アクティブアクティブアクティブ構成では両方のサーバーがトラフィックを捌くことで負荷を分散します。これらのサーバーがパブリックなものの場合、DNSは両方のサーバーのパブリックIPを知っている必要があります。もし、プライベートなものな場合、アプリケーションロジックが両方のサーバーの情報について知っている必要があります。アクティブ・アクティブなフェイルオーバーはマスター・マスターフェイルオーバーと呼ばれることもあります。短所: フェイルオーバーフェイルオーバーではより多くのハードウェアを要し、複雑さが増します。最新の書き込みがパッシブサーバーに複製される前にアクティブが落ちると、データ欠損が起きる潜在可能性があります。レプリケーションマスター・スレーブ　と　マスター・マスターこのトピックは データベース セクションにおいてより詳細に解説されています:マスター・スレーブ レプリケーションマスター・マスター

CDNコンテンツデリバリーネットワーク(CDN)は世界中に配置されたプロキシサーバーのネットワークがユーザーに一番地理的に近いサーバーからコンテンツを配信するシステムのことです。AmazonのCloudFrontなどは例外的にダイナミックなコンテンツも配信しますが、一般的に、HTML/CSS/JS、写真、そして動画などの静的ファイルがCDNを通じて配信されます。そのサイトのDNSがクライアントにどのサーバーと交信するかという情報を伝えます。CDNを用いてコンテンツを配信することで以下の二つの理由でパフォーマンスが劇的に向上します:ユーザーは近くにあるデータセンターから受信できるバックエンドサーバーはCDNが処理してくれるリクエストに関しては処理する必要がなくなりますプッシュCDNプッシュCDNではサーバーデータに更新があった時には必ず、新しいコンテンツを受け取る方式です。コンテンツを用意し、CDNに直接アップロードし、URLをCDNを指すように指定するところまで、全て自分で責任を負う形です。コンテンツがいつ期限切れになるのか更新されるのかを設定することができます。コンテンツは新規作成時、更新時のみアップロードされることでトラフィックは最小化される一方、ストレージは最大限消費されてしまいます。トラフィックの少ない、もしくは頻繁にはコンテンツが更新されないサイトの場合にはプッシュCDNと相性がいいでしょう。コンテンツは定期的に再びプルされるのではなく、CDNに一度のみ配置されます。プルCDNプルCDNでは一人目のユーザーがリクエストした時に、新しいコンテンツをサービスのサーバーから取得します。コンテンツは自分のサーバーに保存して、CDNを指すURLを書き換えます。結果として、CDNにコンテンツがキャッシュされるまではリクエスト処理が遅くなります。time-to-live (TTL) はコンテンツがどれだけの期間キャッシュされるかを規定します。プルCDNはCDN 上でのストレージスペースを最小化しますが、有効期限が切れたファイルが更新前にプルされてしまうことで冗長なトラフィックに繋がってしまう可能性があります。大規模なトラフィックのあるサイトではプルCDNが相性がいいでしょう。というのも、トラフィックの大部分は最近リクエストされ、CDNに残っているコンテンツにアクセスするものであることが多いからです。欠点: CDNCDNのコストはトラフィック量によって変わります。もちろん、CDNを使わない場合のコストと比較するべきでしょう。TTLが切れる前にコンテンツが更新されると陳腐化する恐れがあります。CDNでは静的コンテンツがCDNを指すようにURLを更新する必要があります。その他の参考資料、ページグローバルに分散されたコンテンツデリバリーネットワークプッシュCDNとプルCDNの違いWikipediaロードバランサー

patternsロードバランサーは入力されるクライアントのリクエストをアプリケーションサーバーやデータベースへと分散させる。どのケースでもロードバランサーはサーバー等計算リソースからのレスポンスを適切なクライアントに返す。ロードバランサーは以下のことに効果的です:リクエストが状態の良くないサーバーに行くのを防ぐリクエストを過剰に送るのを防ぐ特定箇所の欠陥でサービスが落ちることを防ぐロードバランサーは (費用の高い) ハードウェアもしくはHAProxyなどのソフトウェアで実現できる。他の利点としては:SSL termination - 入力されるリクエストを解読する、また、サーバーレスポンスを暗号化することでバックエンドのサーバーがこのコストが高くつきがちな処理を請け負わなくていいように肩代わりします。X.509 certificates をそれぞれのサーバーにインストールする必要をなくしますセッション管理 - クッキーを取り扱うウェブアプリがセッション情報を保持していない時などに、特定のクライアントのリクエストを同じインスタンスへと流します。障害に対応するために、アクティブ・パッシブ もしくは アクティブ・アクティブ モードのどちらにおいても、複数のロードバランサーを配置するのが一般的です。ロードバランサーは以下のような種々のメトリックを用いてトラフィックルーティングを行うことができます:ランダムLeast loadedセッション/クッキーラウンドロビンもしくは加重ラウンドロビンLayer 4Layer 7Layer 4 ロードバランシングLayer 4 ロードバランサーは トランスポートレイヤー を参照してどのようにリクエストを配分するか判断します。一般的に、トランスポートレイヤーとしては、ソース、送信先IPアドレス、ヘッダーに記述されたポート番号が含まれますが、パケットの中身のコンテンツは含みません。 Layer 4 ロードバランサーはネットワークパケットを上流サーバーへ届け、上流サーバーから配信することでネットワークアドレス変換 Network Address Translation (NAT) を実現します。Layer 7 ロードバランシングLayer 7 ロードバランサーは アプリケーションレイヤー を参照してどのようにリクエストを配分するか判断します。ヘッダー、メッセージ、クッキーなどのコンテンツのことです。Layer 7 ロードバランサーはネットワークトラフィックの終端を受け持ち メッセージを読み込み、ロードバランシングの判断をし、選択したサーバーとの接続を繋ぎます。例えば layer 7 ロードバランサーは動画のトラフィックを直接、そのデータをホストしているサーバーにつなぐと同時に、決済処理などのより繊細なトラフィックをセキュリティ強化されたサーバーに流すということもできる。柔軟性とのトレードオフになりますが、 layer 4 ロードバランサーではLayer 7ロードバランサーよりも所要時間、計算リソースを少なく済ませることができます。ただし、昨今の汎用ハードウェアではパフォーマンスは最小限のみしか発揮できないでしょう。水平スケーリングロードバランサーでは水平スケーリングによってパフォーマンスと可用性を向上させることができます。手頃な汎用マシンを追加することによってスケールアウトさせる方が、一つのサーバーをより高価なマシンにスケールアップする（垂直スケーリング）より費用対効果も高くなり、結果的に可用性も高くなります。また、汎用ハードウェアを扱える人材を雇う方が、特化型の商用ハードウェアを扱える人材を雇うよりも簡単でしょう。欠点: 水平スケーリング水平的にスケーリングしていくと、複雑さが増す上に、サーバーのクローニングが必要になる。サーバーはステートレスである必要がある: ユーザーに関連するセッションや、プロフィール写真などのデータを持ってはいけないセッションは一元的なデータベース (SQL、 NoSQL)などのデータストアにストアされるか キャッシュ (Redis、 Memcached)に残す必要があります。キャッシュやデータベースなどの下流サーバーは上流サーバーがスケールアウトするにつれてより多くの同時接続を保たなければなりません。欠点: ロードバランサーロードバランサーはリソースが不足していたり、設定が適切でない場合、システム全体のボトルネックになる可能性があります。単一障害点を除こうとしてロードバランサーを導入した結果、複雑さが増してしまうことになります。ロードバランサーが一つだけだとそこが単一障害点になってしまいます。一方で、ロードバランサーを複数にすると、さらに複雑さが増してしまいます。その他の参考資料、ページNGINX

ユーザー、 プロダクト のように三つにすることで、データベース一つあたりの書き込み・読み取りのトラフィックが減り、その結果レプリケーションのラグも短くなります。データベースが小さくなることで、メモリーに収まるデータが増えます。キャッシュの局所性が高まるため、キャッシュヒット率も上がります。単一の中央マスターで書き込みを直列化したりしないため、並列で書き込みを処理することができ、スループットの向上が期待できます。欠点: federation大規模な処理やテーブルを要するスキーマの場合、フェデレーションは効果的とは言えないでしょう。どのデータベースに読み書きをするのかを指定するアプリケーションロジックを更新しなければなりません。server linkで二つのデータベースからのデータを連結するのはより複雑になるでしょう。フェデレーションでは追加のハードウェアが必要になり、複雑性も増します。その他の参考資料、ページ:

シャーディングシャードに対応するようにアプリケーションロジックを変更しなければなりません。結果としてSQLクエリが複雑になります。シャードではデータ配分がいびつになってしまう可能性があります。例えば、標準ユーザーの集合を持つシャードがある場合、そのシャードが他のシャードよりも重い負荷を負うことになります。リバランシングをすると複雑性がより増します。consistent hashing

hashing非正規化非正規化では、書き込みのパフォーマンスをいくらか犠牲にして読み込みのパフォーマンスを向上させようとします。計算的に重いテーブルの結合などをせずに、複数のテーブルに冗長なデータのコピーが書き込まれるのを許容します。いくつかのRDBMS例えば、PostgreSQL やOracleはこの冗長な情報を取り扱い、一貫性を保つためのmaterialized views という機能をサポートしています。フェデレーション や シャーディングなどのテクニックによってそれぞれのデータセンターに分配されたデータを合一させることはとても複雑な作業です。非正規化によってそのような複雑な処理をしなくて済むようになります。多くのシステムで、100対1あるいは1000対1くらいになるくらい読み取りの方が、書き込みのトラフィックよりも多いことでしょう。読み込みを行うために、複雑なデータベースのジョイン処理が含まれるものは計算的に高価につきますし、ディスクの処理時間で膨大な時間を費消してしまうことになります。欠点: 非正規化データが複製される。冗長なデータの複製が同期されるように制約が存在し、そのことでデータベース全体の設計が複雑化する。非正規化されたデータベースは過大な書き込みを処理しなければならない場合、正規化されているそれよりもパフォーマンスにおいて劣る可能性がある。その他の参考資料、ページ: 非正規化DenormalizationSQLチューニングSQLチューニングは広範な知識を必要とする分野で多くの

の方が効率的に速くランダムにデータにアクセスできます。 一方、 VARCHAR では次のデータに移る前にデータの末尾を検知しなければならないために速度が犠牲になります。ブログの投稿など、大きなテキストには TEXT を使いましょう。 TEXT ではブーリアン型の検索も可能です。 TEXT フィールドには、テキストブロックが配置されている、ディスク上の場所へのポインターが保存されます。2の32乗や40億以下を超えない程度の大きな数には INT を使いましょう。通貨に関しては小数点表示上のエラーを避けるために DECIMAL を使いましょう。大きな BLOBS を保存するのは避けましょう。どこからそのオブジェクトを取ってくることができるかの情報を保存しましょう。VARCHAR(255) は8ビットで数えられる最大の文字数です。一部のDBMSでは、1バイトの利用効率を最大化するためにこの文字数がよく使われます。検索性能向上のため 、可能であれば NOT NULL 制約を設定しましょう。インデックスを効果的に用いるクエリ(SELECT、 GROUP BY、 ORDER BY、 JOIN) の対象となる列にインデックスを使うことで速度を向上できるかもしれません。インデックスは通常、平衡探索木であるB木の形で表されます。B木によりデータは常にソートされた状態になります。また検索、順次アクセス、挿入、削除を対数時間で行えます。インデックスを配置することはデータをメモリーに残すことにつながりより容量を必要とします。インデックスの更新も必要になるため書き込みも遅くなります。大量のデータをロードする際には、インデックスを切ってからデータをロードして再びインデックスをビルドした方が速いことがあります。高負荷なジョインを避けるパフォーマンス上必要なところには非正規化を適用するテーブルのパーティションテーブルを分割し、ホットスポットを独立したテーブルに分離してメモリーに乗せられるようにする。クエリキャッシュを調整する場合によってはクエリキャッシュ

ワーカーがキャッシュされたオブジェクトの中で最新のものを集めてきます何をキャッシュするか:ユーザーのセッション完全にレンダーされたウェブページアクテビティストリームユーザーグラフデータいつキャッシュを更新するかキャッシュに保存できる容量は限られているため、自分のケースではどのキャッシュ手法が一番いいかは検討する必要があります。キャッシュアサイド      Source: From cache to in-memory data gridアプリケーションはストレージへの読み書きの処理をします。キャッシュはストレージとは直接やりとりをしません。アプリケーションは以下のことをします:キャッシュの中のエントリを参照しますが、結果としてキャッシュミスになりますデータベースからエントリを取得しますエントリをキャッシュに追加しますエントリを返しますdef get_user(self, user_id):    user = cache.get(\""user.{0}\"", user_id)    if user is None:        user = db.query(\""SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}\"", user_id)        if user is not None:            key = \""user.{0}\"".format(user_id)            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))    return userMemcached は通常このように使われる。その後のキャッシュデータ読み込みは速いです。キャッシュアサイドはレージーローディングであるとも言われます。リクエストされたデータのみがキャッシュされ、リクエストされていないデータでキャッシュが溢れるのを防止します。欠点: キャッシュアサイド各キャッシュミスは三つのトリップを呼び出すことになり、体感できるほどの遅延が起きてしまいます。データベースのデータが更新されるとキャッシュデータは古いものになってしまいます。time-to-live (TTL)を設定することでキャッシュエントリの更新を強制的に行う、もしくはライトスルーを採用することでこの問題は緩和できます。ノードが落ちると、新規の空のノードで代替されることでレイテンシーが増加することになります。ライトスルー      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsアプリケーションはキャッシュをメインのデータストアとして使い、そこにデータの読み書きを行います。一方、キャッシュはデータベースへの読み書きを担当します。アプリケーションはキャッシュにあるエントリを追加・更新しますキャッシュは同期的にデータストアに書き込みを行いますエントリを返しますアプリケーションコード:set_user(12345, {\""foo\"":\""bar\""})キャッシュコード:def set_user(user_id, values):    user = db.query(\""UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}\"", user_id, values)    cache.set(user_id, user)ライトスルーは書き込み処理のせいで全体としては遅いオペレーションですが、書き込まれたばかりのデータに関する読み込みは速いです。ユーザー側は一般的にデータ更新時の方が読み込み時よりもレイテンシーに許容的です。キャッシュ内のデータは最新版で保たれます。欠点: ライトスルーノードが落ちたこと、もしくはスケーリングによって新しいノードが作成された時に、新しいノードはデータベース内のエントリーが更新されるまではエントリーをキャッシュしません。キャッシュアサイドとライトスルーを併用することでこの問題を緩和できます。書き込まれたデータの大部分は一度も読み込まれることはありません。このデータはTTLによって圧縮することができます。ライトビハインド (ライトバック)      Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patternsライトビハインドではアプリケーションは以下のことをします:キャッシュのエントリーを追加・更新しますデータストアへの書き込みを非同期的に行うことで、書き込みパフォーマンスを向上させます。欠点: ライトビハインドキャッシュがデータストア内のコンテンツにヒットする前にキャッシュが落ちるとデータ欠損が起きる可能性があります。キャッシュアサイドやライトスルーよりも実装が複雑になります。リフレッシュアヘッド      Source: From cache to in-memory data grid期限切れよりも前に、直近でアクセスされた全てのキャッシュエントリを自動的に更新するように設定することができます。もしどのアイテムが将来必要になるのかを正確に予測することができるのならば、リードスルーよりもレイテンシーを削減することができます。欠点: リフレッシュアヘッドどのアイテムが必要になるかの予測が正確でない場合にはリフレッシュアヘッドがない方がレイテンシーは良いという結果になってしまいます。欠点: キャッシュcache invalidationなどを用いて、データベースなどの真のデータとキャッシュの間の一貫性を保つ必要があります。Redisやmemcachedを追加することでアプリケーション構成を変更する必要があります。Cache invalidationも難しいですがそれに加えて、いつキャッシュを更新するかという複雑な問題にも悩まされることになります。その他の参考資料、ページFrom cache to in-memory data gridスケーラブルなシステムデザインパターンスケールできるシステムを設計するためのイントロダクションスケーラビリティ、可用性、安定性、パターンスケーラビリティAWS ElastiCacheのストラテジーWikipedia非同期処理      Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale非同期のワークフローはもし、連続的に行われるとリクエスト時間を圧迫してしまうような重い処理を別で処理する手法です。また、定期的にデータを集合させるなどの時間がかかるような処理を前もって処理しておくことにも役立ちます。メッセージキューメッセージキューはメッセージを受け取り、保存し、配信します。もし、処理がインラインで行うには遅すぎる場合、以下のようなワークフローでメッセージキューを用いるといいでしょう:アプリケーションはジョブをキューに配信し、ユーザーにジョブステータスを伝えます。ワーカーがジョブキューから受け取って、処理を行い、終了したらそのシグナルを返します。ユーザーの処理が止まることはなく、ジョブはバックグラウンドで処理されます。この間に、クライアントはオプションとして、タスクが完了したかのように見せるために小規模の処理を行います。例えば、ツイートを投稿するときに、ツイートはすぐにあなたのタイムラインに反映されたように見えますが、そのツイートが実際に全てのフォロワーに配信されるまでにはもう少し時間がかかっているでしょう。Redis はシンプルなメッセージ仲介としてはいいですが、メッセージが失われてしまう可能性があります。RabbitMQ はよく使われていますが、'AMQP'プロトコルに対応して、自前のノードを立てる必要があります。Amazon SQS という選択肢もありますが、レイテンシーが高く、メッセージが重複して配信されてしまう可能性があります。タスクキュータスクキューはタスクとその関連するデータを受け取り、処理した上でその結果を返します。スケジュール管理をできるほか、バックグラウンドでとても重いジョブをこなすこともできます。Celery はスケジューリングとpythonのサポートがあります。バックプレッシャーもし、キューが拡大しすぎると、メモリーよりもキューの方が大きくなりキャッシュミスが起こり、ディスク読み出しにつながり、パフォーマンスが低下することにつながります。バックプレッシャーはキューサイズを制限することで回避することができ、高いスループットを確保しキューにすでにあるジョブについてのレスポンス時間を短縮できます。キューがいっぱいになると、クライアントはサーバービジーもしくはHTTP 503をレスポンスとして受け取りまた後で時間をおいてアクセスするようにメッセージを受け取ります。クライアントはexponential backoffなどによって後ほど再度時間を置いてリクエストすることができます。欠点: 非同期処理キューを用いることで遅延が起こり、複雑さも増すため、あまり重くない計算処理やリアルタイムワークフローにおいては同期処理の方がいいでしょう。その他の参考資料、ページIt's

はクライアントとサーバー間でのデータをエンコードして転送するための手法です。リクエスト・レスポンスに関わるプロトコルです。クライアントがリクエストをサーバーに投げ、サーバーがリクエストに関係するコンテンツと完了ステータス情報をレスポンスとして返します。HTTPは自己完結するので、間にロードバランサー、キャッシュ、エンクリプション、圧縮などのどんな中間ルーターが入っても動くようにできています。基本的なHTTPリクエストはHTTP動詞(メソッド)とリソース(エンドポイント)で成り立っています。以下がよくあるHTTP動詞です。:動詞詳細冪等性*セーフキャッシュできるかGETリソースを読み取るYesYesYesPOSTリソースを作成するもしくはデータを処理するトリガーNoNoYes レスポンスが新しい情報を含む場合PUTリソースを作成もしくは入れ替えるYesNoNoPATCHリソースを部分的に更新するNoNoYes レスポンスが新しい情報を含む場合DELETEリソースを削除するYesNoNo何度呼んでも同じ結果が返ってくることHTTPはTCP や UDP などの低級プロトコルに依存しているアプリケーションレイヤーのプロトコルである。その他の参考資料、ページ: HTTPHTTPってなに?HTTP と TCPの違いPUT と PATCHの違い伝送制御プロトコル (TCP)      Source: How to make a multiplayer gameTCPはIP networkの上で成り立つ接続プロトコルです。接続はhandshakeによって開始、解除されます。全ての送信されたパケットは欠損なしで送信先に送信された順番で到達するように以下の方法で保証されています:シーケンス番号とchecksum fieldsが全てのパケットに用意されているAcknowledgementパケットと自動再送信もし送信者が正しいレスポンスを受け取らなかったとき、パケットを再送信します。複数のタイムアウトがあったとき、接続は解除されます。TCP はフロー制御 と 輻輳制御も実装しています。これらの機能によって速度は低下し、一般的にUDPよりも非効率な転送手段になっています。ハイスループットを実現するために、ウェブサーバーはかなり大きな数のTCP接続を開いておくことがあり、そのことでメモリー使用が圧迫されます。ウェブサーバスレッドと例えばmemcached サーバーの間で多数のコネクションを保っておくことは高くつくかもしれません。可能なところではUDPに切り替えるだけでなくコネクションプーリングなども役立つかもしれません。TCPは高い依存性を要し、時間制約が厳しくないものに適しているでしょう。ウェブサーバー、データベース情報、SMTP、FTPやSSHなどの例に適用されます。以下の時にUDPよりもTCPを使うといいでしょう:全てのデータが欠損することなしに届いてほしいネットワークスループットの最適な自動推測をしてオペレーションしたいユーザデータグラムプロトコル (UDP)      Source: How to make a multiplayer gameUDPはコネクションレスです。データグラム（パケットのようなもの）はデータグラムレベルでの保証しかされません。データグラムは順不同で受け取り先に到着したりそもそも着かなかったりします。UDPは輻輳制御をサポートしません。TCPにおいてはサポートされているこれらの保証がないため、UDPは一般的に、TCPよりも効率的です。UDPはサブネット上のすべての機器にデータグラムを送信することができます。これはDHCP において役に立ちます。というのも、クライアントはまだIPアドレスを取得していないので、IPアドレスを必要とするTCPによるストリームができないからです。UDPは信頼性の面では劣りますが、VoIP、ビデオチャット、ストリーミングや同時通信マルチプレイヤーゲームなどのリアルタイム性が重視される時にはとても効果的です。TCPよりもUDPを使うのは:レイテンシーを最低限に抑えたい時データ欠損よりも、データ遅延を重視するときエラー修正を自前で実装したいときその他の参考資料、ページ:

interviewRPCではクライアントがリモートサーバーなどの異なるアドレス空間でプロシージャーが処理されるようにします。プロシージャーはローカルでのコールのように、クライアントからサーバーにどのように通信するかという詳細を省いた状態でコードが書かれます。リモートのコールは普通、ローカルのコールよりも遅く、信頼性に欠けるため、RPCコールをローカルコールと区別させておくことが好ましいでしょう。人気のRPCフレームワークは以下です。Protobuf、 Thrift、AvroRPC は リクエストレスポンスプロトコル:クライアントプログラム - クライアントスタブプロシージャーを呼び出します。パラメータはローカルでのプロシージャーコールのようにスタックへとプッシュされていきます。クライアントスタブプロシージャー - プロシージャIDとアーギュメントをパックしてリクエストメッセージにします。クライアント通信モジュール - OSがクライアントからサーバーへとメッセージを送ります。サーバー通信モジュール - OSが受け取ったパケットをサーバースタブプロシージャーに受け渡します。サーバースタブプロシージャー -  結果を展開し、プロシージャーIDにマッチするサーバープロシージャーを呼び出し、結果を返します。サーバーレスポンスは上記のステップを逆順で繰り返します。Sample RPC calls:GET /someoperation?data=anIdPOST /anotheroperation{  \""data\"":\""anId\"";  \""anotherdata\"": \""another value\""}RPCは振る舞いを公開することに焦点を当てています。RPCは内部通信パフォーマンスを理由として使われることが多いです。というのも、使用する状況に合わせてネイティブコールを自作することができるからです。ネイティブライブラリー (aka SDK) を呼ぶのは以下の時:ターゲットのプラットフォームを知っている時ロジックがどのようにアクセスされるのかを管理したいときライブラリー外でエラーがどのようにコントロールされるかを管理したい時パフォーマンスとエンドユーザーエクスペリエンスが最優先の時REST プロトコルに従うHTTP APIはパブリックAPIにおいてよく用いられます。欠点: RPCRPCクライアントとはサービス実装により厳密に左右されることになります。新しいオペレーション、使用例があるたびに新しくAPIが定義されなければなりません。RPCをデバッグするのは難しい可能性があります。既存のテクノロジーをそのまま使ってサービスを構築することはできないかもしれません。例えば、SquidなどのサーバーにRPCコールが正しくキャッシュ されるように追加で骨を折る必要があるかもしれません。Representational state transfer (REST)RESTは、クライアントがサーバーによってマネージされるリソースに対して処理を行うクライアント・サーバーモデルを支持するアーキテキチャスタイルです。サーバーは操作できるもしくは新しいリソースレプレゼンテーションを受け取ることができるようなリソースやアクションのレプレゼンテーションを提供します。すべての通信はステートレスでキャッシュ可能でなければなりません。RESTful なインターフェースには次の四つの特徴があります:特徴的なリソース (URI in HTTP) - どのオペレーションであっても同じURIを使う。HTTP動詞によって変わる (Verbs in HTTP) - 動詞、ヘッダー、ボディを使う自己説明的なエラーメッセージ (status response in HTTP) - ステータスコードを使い、新しく作ったりしないこと。HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - 自分のwebサービスがブラウザで完全にアクセスできること。サンプル REST コール:GET /someresources/anIdPUT /someresources/anId{\""anotherdata\"": \""another value\""}RESTはデータを公開することに焦点を当てています。クライアントとサーバーのカップリングを最小限にするもので、パブリックAPIなどによく用いられます。RESTはURI、 representation through headers、そして、GET、POST、PUT、 DELETE、PATCHなどのHTTP動詞等のよりジェネリックで統一されたメソッドを用います。ステートレスであるのでRESTは水平スケーリングやパーティショニングに最適です。欠点: RESTRESTはデータ公開に焦点を当てているので、リソースが自然に整理されていなかったり、シンプルなヒエラルキーで表せられない時にはよい選択肢とは言えないかもしれません。例えば、とあるイベントのセットにマッチするすべての更新情報を返すと言った処理は簡単にはパスで表現することができません。RESTでは、URIパス、クエリパラメータ、そして場合によってはリクエストボディなどによって実装されることが多いでしょう。RESTは少数の動詞に依存しています(GET、POST、PUT、DELETE、そして PATCH) が時には使いたい事例に合わないことがあります。例えば、期限の切れたドキュメントをアーカイブに移したい場合などはこれらの動詞の中には綺麗にはフィットしません。ネストされたヒエラルキーの中にあるリソースをとってくるのはシングルビューを描画するのにクライアントとサーバー間で数回やりとりしなければなりません。例として、ブログエントリーのコンテンツとそれに対するコメントを表示する場合などです。様々なネットワーク環境で動作する可能性が考えられるモバイルアプリケーションにおいてはこのような複数のやり取りは好ましくありません。時が経つにつれて、APIレスポンスにより多くのフィールドが与えられて、古いクライアントはすでにいらないものも含めてすべてのデータフィールドを受け取ることになります。そのことで、ペイロードが大きくなりすぎて、レイテンシーも拡大することになります。RPCとREST比較OperationRPCRESTサインアップPOST

75,pytorch/pytorch,https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/README.md,Python,"PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU accelerationDeep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd systemYou can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.Our trunk health (Continuous Integration signals) can be found at hud.pytorch.org.More About PyTorchA GPU-Ready Tensor LibraryDynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based AutogradPython FirstImperative ExperiencesFast and LeanExtensions Without PainInstallationBinariesNVIDIA Jetson PlatformsFrom SourcePrerequisitesInstall DependenciesGet the PyTorch SourceInstall PyTorchAdjust Build Options (Optional)Docker ImageUsing pre-built imagesBuilding the image yourselfBuilding the DocumentationPrevious VersionsGetting StartedResourcesCommunicationReleases and ContributingThe TeamLicenseMore About PyTorchAt a granular level, PyTorch is a library that consists of the following components:ComponentDescriptiontorchA Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU supporttorch.autogradA tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torchtorch.jitA compilation stack (TorchScript) to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch codetorch.nnA neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibilitytorch.multiprocessingPython multiprocessing, but with magical memory sharing of torch Tensors across processes. Useful for data loading and Hogwild trainingtorch.utilsDataLoader and other utility functions for convenienceUsually, PyTorch is used either as:A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.Elaborating Further:A GPU-Ready Tensor LibraryIf you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).PyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates thecomputation by a huge amount.We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needssuch as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.And they are fast!Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based AutogradPyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.Most frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.One has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.Changing the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.With PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you tochange the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comesfrom several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such astorch-autograd,autograd,Chainer, etc.While this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.You get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.Python FirstPyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.It is built to be deeply integrated into Python.You can use it naturally like you would use NumPy / SciPy / scikit-learn etc.You can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite librariesand use packages such as Cython and Numba.Our goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.Imperative ExperiencesPyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.When you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.When you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.The stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.We hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.Fast and LeanPyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration librariessuch as Intel MKL and NVIDIA (cuDNN, NCCL) to maximize speed.At the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backendsare mature and have been tested for years.Hence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.The memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.We've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure thatyour deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.This enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.Extensions Without PainWriting new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforwardand with minimal abstractions.You can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch APIor your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy.If you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.No wrapper code needs to be written. You can see a tutorial here and an example here.InstallationBinariesCommands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/NVIDIA Jetson PlatformsPython wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1/TX2, Jetson Xavier NX/AGX, and Jetson AGX Orin are provided here and the L4T container is published hereThey require JetPack 4.2 and above, and @dusty-nv and @ptrblck are maintaining them.From SourcePrerequisitesIf you are installing from source, you will need:Python 3.8 or later (for Linux, Python 3.8.1+ is needed)A compiler that fully supports C++17, such as clang or gcc (especially for aarch64, gcc 9.4.0 or newer is required)We highly recommend installing an Anaconda environment. You will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.If you want to compile with CUDA support, select a supported version of CUDA from our support matrix, then install the following:NVIDIA CUDANVIDIA cuDNN v7 or aboveCompiler compatible with CUDANote: You could refer to the cuDNN Support Matrix for cuDNN versions with the various supported CUDA, CUDA driver and NVIDIA hardwareIf you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable USE_CUDA=0.Other potentially useful environment variables may be found in setup.py.If you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are available hereIf you want to compile with ROCm support, installAMD ROCm 4.0 and above installationROCm is currently supported only for Linux systems.If you want to disable ROCm support, export the environment variable USE_ROCM=0.Other potentially useful environment variables may be found in setup.py.Install DependenciesCommonconda install cmake ninja# Run this command from the PyTorch directory after cloning the source code using the “Get the PyTorch Source“ section belowpip install -r requirements.txtOn Linuxconda install mkl mkl-include# CUDA only: Add LAPACK support for the GPU if neededconda install -c pytorch magma-cuda110  # or the magma-cuda* that matches your CUDA version from https://anaconda.org/pytorch/repo# (optional) If using torch.compile with inductor/triton, install the matching version of triton# Run from the pytorch directory after cloningmake tritonOn MacOS# Add this package on intel x86 processor machines onlyconda install mkl mkl-include# Add these packages if torch.distributed is neededconda install pkg-config libuvOn Windowsconda install mkl mkl-include# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed.# Distributed package support on Windows is a prototype feature and is subject to changes.conda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39Get the PyTorch Sourcegit clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorchcd pytorch# if you are updating an existing checkoutgit submodule syncgit submodule update --init --recursiveInstall PyTorchOn LinuxIf you would like to compile PyTorch with new C++ ABI enabled, then first run this command:export _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1If you're compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:# Only run this if you're compiling for ROCmpython tools/amd_build/build_amd.pyInstall PyTorchexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\""$(dirname $(which conda))/../\""}python setup.py developAside: If you are using Anaconda, you may experience an error caused by the linker:build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/torch/csrc/stub.o: file not recognized: file format not recognizedcollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit statuserror: command 'g++' failed with exit status 1This is caused by ld from the Conda environment shadowing the system ld. You should use a newer version of Python that fixes this issue. The recommended Python version is 3.8.1+.On macOSpython3 setup.py developOn WindowsChoose Correct Visual Studio Version.PyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,Professional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools fromhttps://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. The build tools do notcome with Visual Studio Code by default.If you want to build legacy python code, please refer to Building on legacy code and CUDACPU-only buildsIn this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPUconda activatepython setup.py developNote on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you'll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and LIB. The instruction here is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.CUDA based buildIn this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunchingNVTX is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.NVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called \""Nsight Compute\"". To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.Make sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.Currently, VS 2017 / 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If ninja.exe is detected in PATH, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 / 2019. If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.Additional libraries such asMagma, oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL, and Sccache are often needed. Please refer to the installation-helper to install them.You can refer to the build_pytorch.bat script for some other environment variables configurationscmd:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\\mkl\\includeset LIB={Your directory}\\mkl\\lib;%LIB%:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.:: \""Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt\"" will be run automatically.:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.set CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1for /f \""usebackq tokens=*\"" %i in (`\""%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer\\vswhere.exe\"" -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call \""%i\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\"" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compilerset CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.27.29110\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\cl.exepython setup.py developAdjust Build Options (Optional)You can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doingthe following.

Check out this guide for more information on selecting a project.To see the Zero to Mastery Icon in your GitHub profile, follow these steps (you must complete steps 1 and 2 for this to work).Anatomy of an open-source project:Every open-source community is different.Spending years on one open-source project means you’ve gotten to know one open-source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.That being said, many open-source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.A typical open-source project has the following types of people:Author: The person(s) or organization that created the project.Owner: The person(s) who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author).Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (may also be authors or owners of the project).Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page or in the repository for governance documentation to find this information.A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.LICENSE: By definition, every open-source project must have an open-source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.Other documentation: There might be additional documentation such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.Finally, open-source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Discord or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.Get all the ZTM Courses, for one monthly subscription here."

At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.🤗 Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow — with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.Online demosYou can test most of our models directly on their pages from the model hub. We also offer private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API for public and private models.Here are a few examples:In Natural Language Processing:Masked word completion with BERTName Entity Recognition with ElectraText generation with GPT-2Natural Language Inference with RoBERTaSummarization with BARTQuestion answering with DistilBERTTranslation with T5In Computer Vision:Image classification with ViTObject Detection with DETRSemantic Segmentation with SegFormerPanoptic Segmentation with MaskFormerDepth Estimation with DPTVideo Classification with VideoMAEUniversal Segmentation with OneFormerIn Audio:Automatic Speech Recognition with Wav2Vec2Keyword Spotting with Wav2Vec2Audio Classification with Audio Spectrogram TransformerIn Multimodal tasks:Table Question Answering with TAPASVisual Question Answering with ViLTZero-shot Image Classification with CLIPDocument Question Answering with LayoutLMZero-shot Video Classification with X-CLIP100 projects using TransformersTransformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models: it's a community of projects built around it and theHugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyoneelse to build their dream projects.In order to celebrate the 100,000 stars of transformers, we have decided to put the spotlight on thecommunity, and we have created the awesome-transformers page which lists 100incredible projects built in the vicinity of transformers.If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!If you are looking for custom support from the Hugging Face team    Quick tourTo immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:>>> from transformers import pipeline# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')>>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.')[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996980428695679}]The second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here the answer is \""positive\"" with a confidence of 99.97%.Many tasks have a pre-trained pipeline ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image:>>> import requests>>> from PIL import Image>>> from transformers import pipeline# Download an image with cute cats>>> url = \""https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\"">>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw>>> image = Image.open(image_data)# Allocate a pipeline for object detection>>> object_detector = pipeline('object-detection')>>> object_detector(image)[{'score': 0.9982201457023621,  'label': 'remote',  'box': {'xmin': 40, 'ymin': 70, 'xmax': 175, 'ymax': 117}}, {'score': 0.9960021376609802,  'label': 'remote',  'box': {'xmin': 333, 'ymin': 72, 'xmax': 368, 'ymax': 187}}, {'score': 0.9954745173454285,  'label': 'couch',  'box': {'xmin': 0, 'ymin': 1, 'xmax': 639, 'ymax': 473}}, {'score': 0.9988006353378296,  'label': 'cat',  'box': {'xmin': 13, 'ymin': 52, 'xmax': 314, 'ymax': 470}}, {'score': 0.9986783862113953,  'label': 'cat',  'box': {'xmin': 345, 'ymin': 23, 'xmax': 640, 'ymax': 368}}]Here we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score. Here is the original image on the left, with the predictions displayed on the right:        You can learn more about the tasks supported by the pipeline API in this tutorial.In addition to pipeline, to download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, all it takes is three lines of code. Here is the PyTorch version:>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> inputs = tokenizer(\""Hello world!\"", return_tensors=\""pt\"")>>> outputs = model(**inputs)And here is the equivalent code for TensorFlow:>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")>>> inputs = tokenizer(\""Hello world!\"", return_tensors=\""tf\"")>>> outputs = model(**inputs)The tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects, and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.The model itself is a regular Pytorch nn.Module or a TensorFlow tf.keras.Model (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. This tutorial explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our Trainer API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset.Why should I use transformers?Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks.Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.A unified API for using all our pretrained models.Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.Dozens of architectures with over 60,000 pretrained models across all modalities.Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will.Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation and production.Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.Why shouldn't I use transformers?This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, Accelerate).While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our examples folder are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.InstallationWith pipThis repository is tested on Python 3.8+, Flax 0.4.1+, PyTorch 1.10+ and TensorFlow 2.6+.You should install 🤗 Transformers in a virtual environment. If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the user guide.First, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.Then, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow.Please refer to TensorFlow installation page, PyTorch installation page and/or Flax and Jax installation pages regarding the specific installation command for your platform.When one of those backends has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:pip install transformersIf you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you must install the library from source.With condaSince Transformers version v4.0.0, we now have a conda channel: huggingface.🤗 Transformers can be installed using conda as follows:conda install -c huggingface transformersFollow the installation pages of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow to see how to install them with conda.NOTE:  On Windows, you may be prompted to activate Developer Mode in order to benefit from caching. If this is not an option for you, please let us know in this issue.Model architecturesAll the model checkpoints provided by 🤗 Transformers are seamlessly integrated from the huggingface.co model hub where they are uploaded directly by users and organizations.Current number of checkpoints: 🤗 Transformers currently provides the following architectures (see here for a high-level summary of each them):ALBERT (from Google Research and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) released with the paper ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations, by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma, Radu Soricut.ALIGN (from Google Research) released with the paper Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision by Chao Jia, Yinfei Yang, Ye Xia, Yi-Ting Chen, Zarana Parekh, Hieu Pham, Quoc V.
